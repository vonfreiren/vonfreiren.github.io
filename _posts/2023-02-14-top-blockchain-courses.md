## Always into something new
<div class="text-article">

Today in the afternoon, I received an email from INSEAD announcing that they are offering a new specialization called Web3 and Blockchain in Global Commerce Specialization. I received this message in my mailbox, I guess because I took several courses from INSEAD related to Blockchain in the past.



</div>

I did not have the chance to go in detail about this specialization, but it sounds interesting to learn new concepts and refresh the ones I learned a few years ago. I also thought that it could be relevant to other people sharing my experience with other courses.

This post is not about this specialization and I will describe more about it when I complete it. Nonetheless, this purpose of this article is to show the readers that even if it's sometimes not easy to start into the Blockchain world and industries, there are several resources out there that can help you in this mission. We already saw of these resources in another post, so this post will talk mainly about more traditional courses that I enjoyed.


## Blockchain Revolution

### Organization: INSEAD

The Blockchain Revolution course on Coursera is an in-depth exploration of the concepts, applications, and implications of blockchain technology. The course is taught by Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott in collaboration with INSEAD. Both both well-known experts in the field of blockchain and the course is now several years old. The new specialization of the introduction is also taught by the father and his son.

The course is divided into several modules, each of which covers a different aspect of blockchain technology. The first module introduces the basic concepts of blockchain and provides an overview of how it works.

The second one delves deeper into the technical aspects of blockchain, including the various types of consensus algorithms and the role of cryptography in securing blockchain networks.

The third module explores the various applications of blockchain technology, including its potential use in finance, supply chain management, and digital identity verification. The fourth module looks at the potential societal impact of blockchain, including its potential to disrupt traditional power structures and create new economic opportunities.

The fifth module focuses on the practical aspects of building and deploying blockchain solutions, including how to design a blockchain network, select the right consensus algorithm, and ensure security and scalability.

The final module of the course explores the future of blockchain technology, including emerging trends and the potential impact of blockchain on various industries. It's here where the student can put all the learned lessons to work and create a project that will need to submit.

In these courses, the instructors use real-world examples and case studies to illustrate the potential of blockchain technology. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of how blockchain works, its potential applications, and the implications of this technology for businesses, governments, and society as a whole.

If this course was not enough, there is a similar specialization also taught by the Tapscott family and INSEAD. This one comes next in our list.

## Blockchain Revolution in Financial Services

### Organization: INSEAD

The Blockchain Revolution in Financial Services Specialization on Coursera is a series of four courses that explore the potential of blockchain technology to transform the financial industry. They explain the basics like in the first course, but they will go deeper topics related to blockchain in finance.

The first course provides an introduction to blockchain technology and explores its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. Students learn about the various types of blockchain networks, consensus algorithms, and cryptographic techniques that are used to secure blockchain transactions.

The second course focuses on the applications of blockchain in finance, including digital currencies, smart contracts, and asset tokenization. Students learn about the various use cases of blockchain technology in the financial industry, including cross-border payments, trade finance, and securities trading.

The third course delves deeper into the technical aspects of blockchain in finance, including the development of dAppsand the use of smart contracts. Students learn how to build and deploy dApps on blockchain networks and explore the architecture of various blockchain applications in finance.

The final course explores the regulatory and legal considerations of blockchain in finance. Students learn about the challenges of integrating blockchain into existing regulatory frameworks and explore the potential impact of blockchain on financial markets and systems.

From the description and names, you may say some overlaps with the first course. Therefore, it may be a better idea to take this course as a refresher of the initial course.

## Other options

Although these are the courses that I find most complete and interesting, there are other ones that you may want to have a look at.

### Blockchain Specialization

#### Organization: Buffalo University

The first one of this honorable mentions is the Blockchain Specialization. Similar to the ones from INSEAD, students will have the chance to finalize the 3 courses with an applied learning project.

The Blockchain Specialization by Buffalo University on Coursera is a four-course program that covers a comprehensive range of topics related to blockchain technology. The specialization is designed for learners who want to gain practical skills in blockchain development and explore the potential use cases of blockchain in various industries.

The last one included in this article is from Princeton University and more technical than the other ones described in this article.

## More to come

In this article, I have shared my experience a brief description of all the Blockchain and DeFi courses I have taken.

After summarizing several blockchain and cryptocurrency courses on Coursera, in my opinion these courses offer a comprehensive overview of blockchain technology and its potential applications. These courses cover a wide range of topics, from the technical aspects of blockchain development to the potential use cases of blockchain in various industries.

What is especially notable is the hands-on approach that many of these courses take. Students have the opportunity to apply their knowledge through a series of assignments and projects, which allows them to gain practical experience in blockchain development.

In general, these courses provide an excellent foundation for anyone looking to explore the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. Whether you are interested in the technical aspects of blockchain development or the potential applications of blockchain in various industries, these courses offer a wealth of knowledge and practical skills that will prepare you for the future of this rapidly-evolving field.
I will also update you on the Web3 and Blockchain in Global Commerce Specialization and it could be that this is an additional course that we should include in this list.
