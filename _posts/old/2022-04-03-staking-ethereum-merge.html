<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    The world of crypto assets or cryptocurrencies is an ever-changing process
    that, like many others, is looking for the next big trend to continue
    generating digital and real value. This new trend could be Staking, the
    method that rewards users based on the number of coins they back the
    blockchain with. Staking comes from the Proof-Of-Stake, the consensus
    mechanism used in some of the crypto currency networks. Through
    proof-to-stake, some investors are already earning quite considerable
    annual percentage return while generating substantial passive income
    without efforts.
</div>
<h2>
    PoW vs PoS
</h2>
<p>
    Currently, both bitcoin and ether rely on miners to complete complex
    puzzles to validate transactions and create new coins. This process is
    known as proof-of-work (PoW) and requires an enormous amount of energy,
    having negative consequences in the environment. The reason is that for
    this validation process, the PoW consumes a high number of fossil fuels.
    Other cryptos, such as Solana or Algorand, already operate with
    proof-of-stake (PoS), with also quite reasonable returns.
</p>
<p>
    Specifically, the PoS process allows users to validate transactions based
    on the number of coins they contribute or wager. The more coins they wager,
    the higher the probability of validation. This reward can include an annual
    percentage return, and the exact amount depends on the blockchain
    technology used. In addition, Proof of Stake is considered the most
    environmentally friendly option nowadays.
</p>
<p>
    So far, we can distinguish between the following validation mechanisms for
    which the most known tokens are included below:
</p>
<h3>
    Proof of Work
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Bitcoin
    </li>
    <li>
        Ethereum
    </li>
    <li>
        Dogecoin
    </li>
    <li>
        Litecoin
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Proof of Stake
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Solana
    </li>
    <li>
        Cardano
    </li>
    <li>
        Algorand
    </li>
    <li>
        Tezos
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Ethereum Merge
</h2>
<p>
    Ethereum, the blockchain behind ether, could soon launch its long-awaited
    Merge update. The EIP will mean the end of Proof of Work for the Ethereum
    network, transitioning completely to Proof of Stake. Although the final
    schedule for this update is unknown, it is known that it will render
    cryptocurrency mining, based on proof-to-work, obsolete. This process,
    called Beacon, allows users to stake ether to support the blockchain and
    earn returns around 4% to 5%, Some industry experts predict that rewards
    with Merge will range from 7% to 12%.
</p>
<p>
    However, like everything else, staking has some side effects.
    Proof-to-stake essentially bets on the viability of the cryptocurrency
    being staked, so it is subject to the volatility of those digital assets.
    Added to this are potential restrictions on how quickly a cryptocurrency
    can be withdrawn after wagering, certain penalties for not actively
    validating transactions, or minimum amounts required to wager, among other
    issues.
</p>
<p>
    Some myths related to this upgrade are that the high fees of Ethereum will
    be reduced. This is not true and how gas works in Ethereum will not be
    changed. Another misconception was that a new token would be created with
    Ethereum Merge. This is also not true, and Ethereum’s cryptocurrency – ETH
    – will remain the same. In general, the main goal of the Ethereum Merge
    update is making Ethereum cryptographic mining obsolete, reducing its    <strong>environmental impact</strong>, together with enhanced security
    against potential attacks.

<h2>
    What’s next for Ethereum?
</h2>
<p>
    Having seen that Ethereum is evolving, this can have interesting benefits
    for investors and users. In the past years, the rise of NFTs is also thanks
    to Ethereum. Some astonishing figures have been seen in the news in 2021
    and 2022. However, this is completely another topic
</p>
<p>
    Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has been very concerned about the
    future of the blockchain and the use of NFTs (non-fungible tokens).
    According to him, cryptocurrencies were not created "to play with
    million-dollar monkeys, but to do meaningful things in the real world."
</p>
<p>
    In the face of the somewhat uncontrolled boom in non-fungible tokens,
    Buterin believes that many people are not taking advantage of the true
    potential of ether and its blockchain. In particular, he refers to the NFT
    Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, the collection of primate cartoons that have
    become a status symbol in the digital age and for which more than $1
    million has been paid.
</p>
<p>
    In Buterin's view, Ethereum's potential should be harnessed to change the
    world for the better: from fairer voting systems to urban planning and
    public works projects. In particular, he believes the platform could serve
    as a counterweight to authoritarian governments and even end Silicon
    Valley's stranglehold on the digital lives of millions of people.
</p>
<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    There are several interesting projects out there and you may participate on
    those while generating passive income without many efforts. In this post,
    we have briefly introduced what Ethereum Merge will mean. However, in
    future posts we will describe other cryptocurrencies such as Algorand,
    which already use the PoS validation method.
</p>
<p>
    In general, via Staking, we can benefit of diversification, growing our
    income without big efforts. There are different platforms offering
    different APY for several coins, giving us the possibility of some juicy
    returns without doing nothing. Some of these platforms are Nexo or BlockFi.
    Nonetheless, as promised, we will get into details and see on how we can
    start with this.
