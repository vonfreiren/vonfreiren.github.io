<h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
<p>
    In the recent years, we have been suffering a 0% interest rate policy in
    our deposits. In some cases, this has been translated even into negative
    interest into some countries or abusive custody or management fees.
    Further, apart from having to pay to give our money to the bank, we are
    also losing acquisition power every year due to the high inflation and lack
    of reaction from central banks.
</p>
<p>
    I have been always not happy about this topic, since we are lending our
    money to the banks (in some cases charging us for that money) and with that
    money, they lend it to other customers, for which they charge an abusive
    interest rate. I understand that they are companies and they need to have
    benefits. However, they should innovate and provide added value for these
    services. It should not be the case that for literally doing nothing they
    are first charging us, and later using our money to lend it to other
    customers and charging them with high interest and big penalties in case of
</p>
<p>
    Although in the past decades there has not been any breakthrough in
    traditional finance (I just think about ATMs and credit cards), for the
    past years a new concept known as DeFi has been introduced and it’s getting
    more traction. Every year, there are several projects related to it, mainly
    linked to blockchains and different crypto currencies.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of this article is not praising the different benefits of DeFi
    and criticising the traditional finance. The goal is just to show that
    there are more alternatives to depositing the money in the bank, giving us
    a 0% on it.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Wha'ts Anchor?</h2>

<p>
    For that, I am showing those who are not aware of Anchor Protocol. What’s
    this? Anchor is a platform that offers both savings account and a lending
    platform.
</p>
<p>
    In this article we are just focusing on the savings account, for which
    depositors get approximately an APY of 19.5%.
</p>
<p>
    The deposits are in TerraUSD (UST) , which is the Terra stable coin. The
    value of this coin is pegged to the USD and there is a mechanism to make
    sure that the value keeps pegged to the UST. There are some interesting
    videos about this algorithm (and other projects such as White Whale that
    use it to get additional APY on the arbitrage
</p>
<p>
    This means that with a deposit of 10,000 UST, we will get around 2,000 UST
    after one year. The UST is compounded daily and reflected in your deposit.
    For example, in one week, you get around 38 UST with the example above.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the APY slightly varies and it is likely the case that
    once there are several adopters of UST, the APY will reduced.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How to deposit into Anchor Protocol</h2>

<p>
    We have said that the Anchor works with UST. You cannot deposit fiat or any
    other stable coins. Some months ago, it was more difficult to get UST.
    Fortunately, it is now more and more extended and there are more and more
    different options. The last exchange that listed UST was Kraken. In terms
    of fees, this may be also the most convenient one if you are living in
    Europe.
</p>
<p>
    Before explaining briefly the different alternatives, you will need a Terra
    Station wallet. This wallet is the official one from TerraForm Labs and
    it’s used to manage the different Terra tokens (UST, LUNA, etc.)
</p>
<p>
    There are some Chrome extensions and mobile applications for it. Once you
    have set it up, you will be able to send the UST (or LUNA) to your Terra
    Station address.
</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">How to buy UST</h2>

<p>
    There is an option to buy directly UST from Fiat in the Anchor protocol.
    The service is called Transact and it is displayed in the Anchor Protocol
    site. However, the conversion fees are quite high and there are cheaper
    options explained below.
</p>
<p>
    Preparing the document, I have just seen that there is a new option (more
    and more exchanges are listing UST). This service is called Kado Ramp and
    the fee (2 UST) seems more affordable than Transakt.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Kraken</strong>
    <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">https://www.kraken.com/</a>
</p>
<p>
    Kraken is one of the most famous exchanges. In this case, the fiat deposit
    is free. You have options such as EUR and USD and you have pairs EUR/UST
    and USD/UST, meaning that you don’t have to convert to another coin to get
    UST.
</p>
<p>
    The withdrawal fee to your Terra Station is 1 UST. The trading fees are
    quite low and the details are in the website. Expect around 1 UST per 1,000
    EUR.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Binance</strong>
    <a href="https://www.binance.com/">https://www.binance.com/</a>
</p>
<p>
    I cannot give my opinion about Binance US. The solution in Finance is
    depositing USD, and you get BUSD (the stable coin from Binance). This means
    that you are losing some part of the USD because the ratio is not exactly
    1:1. Furthermore, you may also incur some transactions fees or exchange
    rate fees if your account currency is not quoted in USD.
</p>
<p>
    From there, you can buy UST with BUSD. In this exchange, the withdrawal fee
    to the Terra Wallet is also 1 UST.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Coinbase</strong>
    <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">https://www.coinbase.com/</a>
</p>
<p>
    Please note that UST is also available in Coinbase, but this is not native
    UST and you cannot send it directly to Terra Station. You will need to
    convert it (e.g. using MetaMask) and this will incur high fees.
</p>
<p>
    What you can do in Coinbase (Coinbase Pro for smaller fees) is either buying XLM (Stellar) or LTC
    (Litecoin) due to the low trading / transfer fees. You can send those to
    KuCoin and convert them to another stable coin such as USDT in order to
    convert them again to UST. The withdrawal fee in this case is 2 UST (it
    used to be 4 UST).
</p>
<p>
    In Kucoin there are also SOL/UST pairs, so you could buy Solana in Coinbase
    and send it to KuCoin to the different transactions.
</p>
<p>
    This option may be more expensive compared to the ones listed below.
</p>
<p>
    Another option that exists is buying LUNA (TERRA) in any of the stock
    exchanges and sending it to your Terra Station. Terra Station has an option
    to swap LUNA / UST and the fee is 0.1%. This was the most convenient
    approach when UST was not listed in many exchanges.
</p>
<p>
    What Anchor brings is a new concept for people tired of traditional banks
    and abusive rates. This is the crown of the jewell of the DeFi projects out
    there. Furthermore, this is a more conservative approach than buying crypto
    currencies, whose value fluctuates so much.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, this is not a risk-free value and there may be some
    risks to be evaluated:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Smart contracts hack
    </li>
    <li>
        Depeg of UST to USD
    </li>
    <li>
        Losing the Wallet
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    One of my pieces of advice is not putting all the eggs on the same nest,
    regardless of the reputation of the protocol or asset type. In the next
    weeks, I will introduce other DeFi protocols that could be interest to you.
