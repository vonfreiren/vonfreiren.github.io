## A Skill for the Future

With many trends related to new technologies, it's no doubt that more and more people are interested in coding and learning how to build the software. With the expected growth in future years of topics such as artificial intelligence, mobile applications or automation, companies will need more professionals who know how to code.

Although kids learn sooner in school the basics of software development (it depends on each country), the reality is that it's very difficult to find these profiles when posting job offers in this field.

Having understood the importance and knowing that many people did not have the chance to learn coding at school, the purpose of this article is to include several platforms that may you help you with this task and make your learning journey easier.
