<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    It’s said that eyes are the soul's reflection and they are totally right.
    Our look can say man things about how we feel, our emotions and our energy.
</p>
<p>
    Nobody can’t disagree to this statement, but then, why we don’t pay
    attention to these two organs and the muscles around them? The technology
    has brought many advantages to our lifestyle. However, With our time
    exposed to screens and different devices, our eyes are suffering much more
    compared to other times in history
</p>
<h2>
    The importance of the eyes
</h2>
<p>
    Think for a moment about your eyes. You use them all the time when you're
    awake. You blink (between 11,000 and 15,000 times a day), you wink, you
    squint Think for a moment about your eyes. You use them all the time when
    you're awake. You blink (between 11,000 and 15,000 times a day), you wink,
    you squint when you see the price of the new phone or clothes, you rub them
    when you're tired, etc. All in all, you use them for almost everything.
    These actions occur thanks to the number of tiny muscles that surround our
    eyes.
</p>
<p>
    Around our eyes, There are 22 muscles. called periorbital muscles and these
    muscles allow you to enjoy a wide range of gestures and movements. Besides,
    they have some characteristics that make them peculiar and, above all, they
    are clear indicators of how we feel. For example: when you sleep too
    little, don't drink enough water, your diet is not the best one, you are
    tired or sad, you abuse alcohol or any other substances... the eye contour
    is the first part of our body that shows this problem to the world.
</p>
<h2>
    Sensitive Organs
</h2>
<p>
    The skin around your eyes is the thinnest skin on your face. It is five
    times thinner than the rest of your face, and ten times thinner than that
    of other parts of the body. That means it has hardly any sebaceous glands
    and no supporting tissue, which is basically collagen. Therefore, it droops
    sooner.
</p>
<p>
    This causes this area to break down more quickly, leading to wrinkles known
    as crow's feet, and eyelid sagging.
</p>
<h2>
    The impact of sun
</h2>
<p>
    We have just described that the part of the eyes is very sensitive since it
    is a very thin skin. Therefore, it has fewer layers underneath and, exposed
    to Ultraviolet rays. This results in what is known as hyperpigmentation.
    Another cause of this unfortunate coloration is genetics; there are simply
    people who naturally have more dark circles under their eyes than others.
</p>
<p>
    Although fluid retention occurs to women in other parts of the body, in men
    this problem occurs in the eyes are. That’s when appear the feared dreaded
    bags as we get older.
</p>
<p>
    Aging is another critical factor for us. When you are young, the membrane
    is responsible for retaining the fat in the eyelids. But when we gain
    weight or older, the eyes membrane gets thinner and loses strength over
    time,
</p>
<h2>
    How to protect them?
</h2>
<p>
    All in all, we can say that the skin around the eye contour is the thinnest
    in the human body, it has a small number of sebaceous glands and its blood
    microcirculation is very slow. As a result, it is fragile, dehydrates
    easily and accumulates toxins quickly. In addition, and due to constant
    muscle contractions, it is the first area where signs of fatigue or aging
    become visible.
</p>
<p>
    We have seen the different problems men have when it comes to eyes and the
    areas surrounding it. Since it is a very sensitive area, we are exposed to
    the sun, and high-resolution screens, we need to find some ways to protect
    and repair the damage.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, a good diet, sleeping at least 8 hours or drinking enough water
    are of the utmost importance. However, without recurring to cosmetic
    surgery, there are some products that can be our allies to mitigate these
    problems.
