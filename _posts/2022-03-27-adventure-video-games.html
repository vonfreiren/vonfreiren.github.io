<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    While everybody is waiting for the most anticipated games in 2022 and it
    seems that it will be one of the best years in history with the likes of
    God of War: <strong>Ragnarok</strong>, <strong>Elden Ring</strong> or <strong>Horizon Forbidden West</strong>, today we are
    discussing some modern classics. Some of them were already released some
    years ago.
</div>
<p>
    All of them are playable in PS4 and in some cases you can also play in the
    PS5. The good news is that since they were released many years ago, you
    will find them for a very good price. If you are play too many games per year this article may not add much, but if you are a casual gamer like me, you may have missed some of these.
</p>
<h2>
    The Witcher 3
</h2>
<p>
    While the Witcher 1 and Witcher 2 don’t have a great mechanisms and
    controls, The Witcher 3 was a total breakthrough. Apart from continuing
    with a great story, it finally added a fantastic gameplay. It is still
    considered a total piece of art from the Polish company CD Projekt Red.
    These games count the adventures of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher – person
    whose job is killing monsters – who deals with different situations,
    monsters, characters, etc.
</p>
<p>
    In this game, the main enemy is the Wild Hunt- evil elf riders from
    another world -, trying to look for Ciri and you will have to protect her.
    This game also means the end of the story told in the 3 Witcher games. For
    that reason, it is not likely that there will be another game.
</p>
<p>
    If the main game was not enough, there are not 1 but 2 expansions
    available.
</p>
<p>
    The expansions are also excellent, and they are completely different one
    from another
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Hearts of the Stone</strong> focuses on a dark and more mystic adventure. In
        this one, Gerald will meet a mysterious man called Gaunter O’Dimm. Via
        this person, you will be asked to defeat a bandit called Olgierd von
        Everec, who is said to be immortal. The story is based mainly on these
        characters, but you will have to deal with new creatures and different
        mysteries.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Blood and Wine</strong> is the last expansion, set in Toussaint, where the
        landscape will remind you of France or Italy. In this city, you are
        asked by Duchess of Toussaint Anna Henrietta to solve the mystery of different killings
        in this region recently.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In the main game and the expansions, you will have the option to choose
    different paths and all the choices you make will have an in important
    impact on how the story evolves
</p>
<p>
    Related to the main game, it could be good to read some summaries of
    previous games (there is no need to play them) to know what’s going on, the
    different regions and allies or enemies. For this, watching the Netflix
    series will not help much since they are set in different times.

</p>
<h2>
    God of War
</h2>
<p>
    The creators of the God of War saga, Santa Monica Studio, made a great
    transition from their unique hack and slash style included in previous
    games with multiple changes in the last game. Further, it is undeniable
    that all these modifications in the gameplay improved the experience,
    taking profit of the latest consoles.
</p>
<p>
    Not just the gameplay changed, but also where the story is set. Kratos has
    changed Greece for Norway, where he will have to take care of his son,
    Atreus.
    Although I prefer the Greek mythology compared to the Norse one, there was
    not much to see since Kratos had killed almost every Greek god.
</p>
<p>
    Not just in the gameplay or the ambient you can see differences, but in the
    personality of the protagonist. Less selfish and more mature, you can see
    a clear evolution of the character if you have played the first games.
</p>
<p>
    The ghost of Sparta will meet new “friends” such as Baldur, Freya, Magni,
    Modi or Mimir. Apart from these Norse gods, the creatures are such trolls,
    dark elves or draugrs or even dragons. However, the most difficult part of
    the game – if you want to do so - is defeating the 9 Valkyries of the game.
</p>
<p>
    To defeat these enemies, you will also notice that your trusted blades of
    chaos are not anymore with you, and you are using a new weapon: an axe.
    However, as the game advances, you will have to recover the blades of chaos
    in order to defeat new enemies. You will have to guide Kratos through the
    different 6 playable realms
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Misgard
    </li>
    <li>
        Alfheim
    </li>
    <li>
        Helheim
    </li>
    <li>
        Jotunheim
    </li>
    <li>
        Muspelheim
    </li>
    <li>
        Nilfheim
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We are all waiting for the continuation of this game Ragnarok, which is to
    be released end of 2022. Apart from Thor, who know which other gods we will
    see there. Further, in the new game, we will be able to play in the realms
    that were not playable in the previous delivery: Vanaheim, Svartalfheim,
    and Asgard.
</p>
<p>
    In the meantime, if you like the Nordic culture, you may also try Assassins
    Creed Valhalla or check the gameplay below.

<h2>
    The Last of Us
</h2>
<p>
    I have never a fan of zombie, horror, or similar games. However, I bought
    The Last of Us by chance (there was a good offer) having seen the reviews.
    To be honest, I did not have a clue what was it about until I started
    playing it.
</p>
<p>
    This game tells the story of Joel, who is the main character, and Ellie is
    the girl you have to protect. Through the trip and the different
    apocalyptic places, you visit, you will also meet some old friends.
</p>
<p>
    The reason for having to protect her is that I have forgotten to say that
    most humans have an infection (Cordyceps brain infection). For that reason,
    they have become insane, and they attack also non-infected humans. That’s
    why also the status of the different places you visit.
</p>
<p>
    In the story you will find different types of infected who have different
    skills depending on the phase they are (Runners, Stalkers, Clickers, and
    Bloaters)
</p>
<p>
    IF you play at night, with the narrative and sounds, you will undoubtfully
    feel this sensation in any other game (except in the second part of this
    game)
</p>
<p>
    Where the variety of enemies is not as high as in the Witcher or God of War
    (the enemies are the infected and other humans), playing the game is like
    reading a good book or watching a move, where you are expecting to see
    what’s coming next.
</p>
<p>
    The adrenaline when running away from the infected ones, the dramatic turn
    of events, or the ingenuity you must use to defeat the enemies makes this
    game special. Even if it’s the oldest one in the list, the gameplay has not
    aged badly at all.
</p>
<p>
    I have the Last of Us 2 since a few months, but I did not have to play it.
    I cannot wait to do so and probably it could be one of the games that
    should be worth to mention.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, HBO is also preparing series about this where Pedro Pascal
    will play the role of Joel. We cannot wait to see this.
</p>
<p>
    Even if you are not the person who likes this type of games, I would
    encourage you to check some videos and try it.
</p>

</p>
<h2>
    Uncharted 4
</h2>
<p>
    We finalize the list from another game from Naughty Dog. Uncharted 4 is the
    last game of the uncharted saga if you don’t take into account the
    expansion Lost Legacy. The fourth game is still about Nathan Drake, but
    this time he is retired as treasure hunter and adventurer. However, he will
    get soon get disturbed to do one final mission in order to help his
    brother.
</p>
<p>
    In the fourth game of the saga, you will have to search for English pirate
    Henry Avery’s treasure. To do so, you will visit many different locations.
    That’s why you will be able to see gorgeous landscapes, use different ways
    of transport and research in countries such as Panama, Madagascar. Scotland
    or Italy.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from the main timeline, there will be some missions set in the past,
    shown as flashbacks to better understand the story.:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You will for example be in a jail in Panama with your brother Samuel
        and your partner Rafe. This time is set before the events of the first
        game.
    </li>
    <li>
        You will also play a young Nathan when he was at the orphanage in
        Boston.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Although my preferred game is the second one, because of all the changes
    that brought to the series, the fourth and probably last game of the series
    is the most complete one in terms of graphics, visuals, and gameplay. It is
    also the one that closes the circle.
</p>
<p>
    As it occurs in The Last of Us, here you will just fight against humans (in
    previous games you will have to deal with some specific creatures, but I
    will not say more). However, this does not mean that it is worse. As it
    occurs with The Last of Us, here you will see a twisted story, different
    puzzles to be solved and some unexpected events that will hook you to your
    sofa.
</p>
<p>
    Sadly for the fans, the title “A Thief’s End” also may indicate that there
    will be no more Uncharted, unless there is another protagonist. There has
    been recently a film without very good reviews. However, whatever Naughty
    Dog is working on now, it will be a candidate for sure to be included in a
    similar list in the near future.
