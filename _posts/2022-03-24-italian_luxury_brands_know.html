<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    Some posts ago we talked about different stores and brands. In those cases,
    the prices were mainly affordable since the brands, although offer very
    good quality, they are far from being considered luxury brands.
</p>
<p>
    In this article, I present you 4 Italian brands that are the
    exemplification of classic, sophisticated style combined with a delicate
    treatment of the different materials. They have been for some years
    selecting the best materials, and while other brands have preferred to
    focus on other aspects such as the latest trends, finding the best fabrics
    around the world continues to be one of th
    brands.
</p>
<p>
    The prices are of course high, but as opposed to other brands, when it
    comes to the attention to details, quality of fabric and country of
    manufacturing, this can of course be a valid justification.
</p>
<h2>
    Zegna
</h2>
<p>
    One of the staples from Zegna is the suit. Founded in the north of Italy,
    Trivero more specifically, Ermenegildo Zegna created the company in the
    1910s. However, he did not do this alone and his two brothers Mario and
    Edoardo helped him with the task of creating the company and its vision.
    The objective from Zegna was already clear in its inception, more than 100
    years ago:
</p>
<p>
    On one hand, they wanted to always find the best fabrics for each garment
    and each occasion. For that, they used to track different regions in search
    of the best product
</p>
<p>
    On another hand, innovation was already an important pillar of the company,
    combining it together with the best fabrics.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately for the consumers, the vision of the original founder remains
    unchanged today and they have not been transitioned to other styles or
    politics, as it has happened unfortunately with other classic houses.
</p>
<p>
    In Zegna, all materials such as wool and cashmere are carefully selected so
    they are perfect for suits and sweaters. Nonetheless, you will see
    exquisite products such as ties, shirts, or accessories to complete one
    man’s wardrobe.
</p>
<p>
    Although their style is classic, keeping the traditional tailoring as a
    service, called <em>Su Misura</em>, they also have collaborated with other
    brands on the crest of the wave, such as <strong>Fear of God</strong>. Further, thanks to different technologies they have also created the <strong>Tech Merino</strong> collection.
</p>
<p>
    Although the prices are in the top, it is possible to see the quality of
    the different garments from miles away, and you will not be wrong if you go
    for this option.

    other pages such as Mr Porter</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Canali
</h2>
<p>
    2 hours away from Trivero, close to Monza, Canali was founded just a few
    years before the second world war in Triuggio. It was founded by two
    brothers: Giacomo and Giovanni Canali, and the family still plays an
    important role in the company today. A family-owned based company, the
    focus on Canali lies on traditional menswear such as knitwear, suits, and
    shoes.
</p>
<p>
    The idea behind Canali is to keep a classic style but modernize it with
    minor enhancements constantly, also adapting the look to the contemporary
    times. They call it <strong>“modern elegance”</strong> and this term is very appropriate in
    his blog.
</p>
<p>
    Customers also play an important role in Canali’s history and they are
    important for them regardless of who they are. As it occurs with Zegna,
    they also offer an exclusive made to measure service, so you can see that
    the classic style is one of their signatures.
</p>
<p>
    Although it has less history than Zegna, and it is also probably less known,
    you cannot go wrong either if you decide to visit the shop from the
    province of Monza.

<h2>
    E. Marinella
</h2>
<p>
    Since we have introduced two Italian brands from the north, it would be
    fair also to travel to see a different style from the South of Italy. And
    not, we are not checking Dolce &amp; Gabbana or similar. This brand is
    rather unknown and due to the relaxation of the outfits in last years
    (COVID-19 may have something to do), it may have lost presence in the
    recent years.
</p>
<p>
    We are talking about E. Marinella, which was found as Zegna in the 1910s.
    However, the company was created in Naples, where they started with a tiny
    20-meter shop. Marinella means “From the Sea” in Italian and you could
    guess that the shop is related to the Gulf of Naples or the Mediterranean
    Sea. However, the company owes its name to the creator Eugenio Marinella.
</p>
<p>
    However, if you don’t know E. Marinella is focused mainly on ties and
    handkerchiefs and what they wanted to achieve was replicating some of the
    British products and style in Italy. Since the usage of ties is less common
    nowadays, that’s why it may not be as famous one as the other brands listed
    here.
</p>
<p>
    As it occurs with Zegna and Canali, E. Marinella is focused on two
    different aspects:
</p>
<p>
    <strong> Materials </strong>: The characteristic prints and pattern of the ties are designed
    carefully and produced with the best silk prepared exclusively just for
    them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> Craftsmanship </strong>: Although they have invested in different technological
    machinery, some part of the fabrication is still manual, where the works
    prepare the ties with the utmost care. The ties are folded 5, 7 or 9 times to
    themselves, and you can note it when touching them.
</p>
<p>
    Although the format attire is losing more and more presence, we all must
    attend special occasions. For these events, the ties from E Marinella will
    for sure elevate your outfit and you will create an excellent impression to
    the hosts and other guests.
</p>

</p>
<h2>
    Bottega Veneta
</h2>
<p>
    This one is probably the most famous company, especially for women. If you
    know about Italian, you can see that in this case the name is quite simple:
    Bottega means shop and Veneta means Venetian – yes, we have come back to
    the North of Italy for this last section -. This is the only company listed
    in this post that does not have the origin in the founder of the company.
</p>
<p>
    As opposed to other brands, Bottega Veneta is focused more on women’s
    attires, or at least they have more options. Nonetheless, since we have
    already talked about different garments, it’s the time to focus on
    accessories for the daily activities. Bags, wallets, backpacks. This way,
    we complete the list, and we can have an outlook composed of just these
    brands.
</p>
<p>
    Their instant hit was the Intreciatto leather, technique that had been
    tried to replicate or imitated in some brands. It’s also the main
    characteristic today, giving the different accessories a unique feel.
    Intrecciato is called like that because of the way the leather is weaved.
    In the past, in the region the company was created, they were used to work
    just with clothes and the machinery were adapted to garments. In order to
    be able to recycle these machines, the leather had to be super thin. Once
    completed, the workers had to wove with this characteristic pattern to make
    the accessory more resistant.
</p>
<p>
    Although them were acquired 20 years ago approximately, they have not been
    corrupted and they have kept their unique design and exquisite
    craftsmanship. You can also see some of these pieces of art below.

    Alla prossima
</h2>
<p>
    There are more Italian and non-Italian brands to come. For example, there
    are some brands from Italy which will be included in the future are the
    ones like <a href="https://www.bogliolimilano.com/">Boglioli</a>,<a href="https://www.corneliani.com/">Corneliani</a>,<a href="https://www.palzileri.com/fr/">Pal Zileri</a> or    <a href="https://www.slowear.com/">Incotex</a> (Slowear group). For the
    moment, we have seen a few and I hope that you have discovered at least one
    interesting company.
