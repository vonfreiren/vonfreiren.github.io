<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    <p>
        It’s true that some of the most wanted and known watches will be out of
        budget for most of us. We have seen that the prices of luxury watches have
        gone to the roof in the last years. They have been mainly used for
        investment, hedging and protection against inflation, similar to what’s
        done with other alternative assets. That’s main reason for having seen the
        prices in primary and secondary markets skyrocketed. Although even if it
        said that watches are an investment on many occasions, in most cases this
        will not be true and even if you are an experienced professional, it would
        not be advisable to follow these steps.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    Anyway, the topic of this article is not to discuss luxury articles
    or investments, but the opposite. In this post, the focus is to show some
    affordable but good-looking watches that will look like a luxury watch and
    will not disappoint any watch collector.
</p>
</p>
</p>
<h2>
    1. Orient Bambino
</h2>
<p>
    We start the list with a fine piece coming from Japan. It may be a
    non-famous brand for some, but Orient belongs to the Seiko group
</p>
<p>
    The Orient Bambino is possibly one of the best affordable automatic dress
    watches available on the market today. A piece appreciated even by the most
    demanding collectors, despite not being a high value jewel.
</p>
<p>
    Essentially, we are dealing in this case with a vintage-style watch with a
    clean and traditional design equipped with a precise mechanism, whose
    quality is endorsed by Orient, a Japanese watch brand whose tradition dates
    back to 1950, although it currently belongs to Seiko, another guarantee of
    quality.
</p>
<p>
    The best thing about the Orient Bambino is that they move in a fairly
    affordable price range, so they are an excellent starting point for those
    who want to start collecting watches without spending a fortune, but who
    also want to be recognized among others. the connoisseurs in watches.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the success and the sales of the Bambino, there are around 10
    version of this watch. If I had to choose one, my favorite one will be the
    one with the blue dial.
</p>

<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/affordable_watches/orient_bambino.jpeg" alt="Classic and elegant">
    <span class="caption text-muted">If you are starting with your collection, the Orient Bambino will be ideal as a dress watch </span>
</p>
<p>
    From the first glance you will be fascinated by the contrast of the dial of
    this Orient Bambino v4 fac08004d model. The dial is characterized by an
    ocean blue color in the central part that gradually intensifies until it
    reaches the edges, where it reaches a contrasting black.
</p>
<p>
    The strap is black and made of high-quality leather, a feature that makes
    it extremely comfortable and easy to wear.
</p>
<p>
    The diameter of the case is 42.5 mm, ideal for any type of wrist, both
    small and large, the case has a perfectly round shape that is very
    reminiscent of vintage watches.
</p>
<p>
    All bambino versions are water-resistant up to 30 meters. However, since it
    is a dress watch and because of the leather strap, swimming with it will
    not be recommendable.
</p>
<p>
    If you are looking for a classic watch, the best value for money out there
    may be the Bambino and one of their versions.

    2. Seiko Save the Ocean Series
</h2>
<p>
    Since we have introduced one Orient model, there is no doubt we would be
    also taking about Seiko. If we are presenting affordable and quality
    watches, there is no doubt that Seiko must be on the list. As it would be
    impossible to include the different models that could be included in this
    list, we have decided to include a limited edition of Seiko, which not be
    known to some.
</p>
<p>
    The new Seiko Prospex Save the Ocean are another example of how Seiko
    continues to dive deeper and deeper into its passion for underwater
    watchmaking, of which we have already seen some examples). Back in 2018, at
    Baselworld, the Japanese manufacturer announced Fabien Cousteau as the new
    ambassador, grandson of the legendary Jacques Cousteau, the French
    biologist and oceanographer who taught us to love the oceans.
</p>
<p>
    If you have realized about the name, you may guess that here we are talking
    about a watch related to the sea. When it comes to orology, this is of
    course related to diver watches, which also means that they are certified.
</p>

<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/affordable_watches/seiko_ocean.jpeg" alt="Ideal for Summer">
    <span class="caption text-muted">The Save the Ocean models are ideal for wearing on the beach (or pool)</span>
</p>
<p>
    There are so many unique models in this limited edition and for that reason
    it is not possible to focus on all of them. That’s why I will focus on my
    favorite version of this edition is the Seiko Save the Ocean Black Series.
    Since they a covered by black PVC, they have a more elegant look
</p>
<p>
    We have already said that there are different models, colors, and type of
    watches: Turtle, Samurai and these models will adapt to your wrist.
    Therefore, in this collection you will find multiple versatile options for
    your collection.

    3. G-Shock GA-2100
</h2>
<p>
    We end our trip to Japan, with a low-cost but high-quality company producer
    Casio. In the 80s, a small team of engineers from Casio led by Ibe Kikuo
    started working a new project. Due to the fragility and delicacy of the
    watches at that time, their goal was to create an indestructible watch that
    would be valid for different occasions. One of them was the one related to
    those workers in the industry.
</p>
<p>
    With not very success at the start, mainly because the sales on the home
    country did not bring the attention of the Japanese, it started
    surprisingly to catch the eye of Americans and Europeans. It has now become
    one of the watches that almost every collector and part of a niche-market.
</p>

<p>
    Ever since, they have brought different breakthroughs to the watch
    industry. From solar energy to Bluetooth connectivity, it has always
    remained at the forefront of technology, design, and functionality,
    accompanying its evolution.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/affordable_watches/casioak.jpeg" alt="Future Classic">
    <span class="caption text-muted">The same that happened with other Casio models, there is no doubt that the GA-2100 will become a classic</span>
</p>
<p>
    G-Shock has created different iconic watches over the years. One of the most
    recent ones, Nicknamed the CasioOak for having a similar - but much more
    affordable - design (octogonal shape too) to the one of the Royal Oak from the Audemars Piguet,
    the G-Shock was an instant hit when it was released in 2020.
</p>
<p>
    The G-Shock GA-2100 is not as rough as other G-Shock models. It’s quite thin. For instance:
    example: at 11.8mm, it's the thinnest G-Shock currently makes. It's also a
    predominantly analog piece, with two hands and a physical day indicator. On
    the other hand, it also has a number of digital complications, including a
    timer, stopwatch, world time, calendar, and LED light. The most iconic
    version is the total black CasioOak, and that my seem that it is not easy
    to read, this is not true once you try it.
</p>
<p>
    In the past, one of the characteristics for which G-Shock had some
    detractors, is that their design was not the most sophisticated and elegant
    one. However, with the GA-2100, this is not an argument they may use. The
    GA-2100 model combines both elegance and robustness, making it an
    indestructible yet beautiful piece.

<h2>
    4. Tissot PRX
</h2>
<p>
    The decades of 70s and 80s were good decades for music lovers with special
    mention to disco music. In 1978, the first Superman was released in the
    cinemas and Argentina – without Maradona- won their first football world
    cup home. It was also in 1978 when the Swiss manufacturer Tissot released
    the PRX.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/affordable_watches/tissot.jpeg" alt="A Blast from the Past">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Tissot is making very interesting products in the last years and the PRX is probably the most relevant surprise</span>
</p>
<p>
    The PRX had an integrated steel bracelet, a barrel-shaped case which evoked
    a classic and clean design. In 2021, Tissot decided to reedit this model
    and generated very good reviews and good opinions.
</p>
<p>
    The name maybe a bit unknown for the users, but they are synonyms of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        P: Precise
    </li>
    <li>
        R: Robust
    </li>
    <li>
        X: It’s a reference to the water resistance of 10 (X) bars.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The reedition of this watch was an instant hit. It can be used as both
    dress or sports watch, and it also has some similarities with the Audemars
    Piguet Royal Oak or the Vacheron Constantin Overseas. Because of the good
    feedback, Tissot had also the idea of having new versions in 2022, like the
    chronographer, which is slightly bigger
</p>
<p>
    Either for a classic version or one of the latest versions, you will get a
    polyvalent and elegant watch that will not disappoint.
