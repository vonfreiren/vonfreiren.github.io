## AI Power

<div class="text-article">
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the` potential `to revolutionize the way we work and improve` productivity `across various industries. In the software development industry, AI is already being used to improve` productivity `in several ways.</div>

One of the most common ways AI is being used to improve software` productivity `is through the use of code completion tools. These tools use AI algorithms to suggest code snippets or complete entire lines of code based on the` context `of the current project. This can save developers a significant amount of time and effort by reducing the need for manual coding. Some examples of code completion tools include DeepTabNine, Kite, and TabNine.

Coding is a complex and time-consuming task that requires a lot of focus and attention to detail. However, there are many tools available that can help you improve your` productivity `and streamline your workflow. In this article, we will discuss some of the most popular tools that you can use to improve your coding productivity.

There are different ways to increase what we do in less time. IDEs, project management tools and methodologies or automations tools and some of these examples. Probably some of these improvements can also come from non-technology methods, but improving our lifestyle, focus and nutrition.

Nonetheless, we will leave them for another time. Today we are going to discuss what AI can do in terms of efficiency. We are going to show two of the benefits of using them in our daily life. For this article, we will focus of one of the state-of-the-art tools, both of them powered by the OpenAI codex.

## GitHub Copilot

Starting with Microsoft, GitHub Copilot is a powerful AI-powered code completion` tool `that allows developers to write code more efficiently and with fewer errors. This powerful` tool `can help developers to increase their` productivity `by reducing the time it takes to complete repetitive or complex tasks.

One of the main features of GitHub Copilot is its ability to provide code` suggestions `as developers type. This can help to save time by eliminating the need to manually search for the correct syntax or function. Additionally, Copilot also provides context-aware suggestions, which means that it can suggest different options based on the specific` context `of the code.

Another useful feature of GitHub Copilot is its ability to automatically fix common coding errors. This can save developers a significant amount of time, as they no longer need to spend time searching for and fixing errors. Additionally, Copilot can also help to improve code quality by suggesting improvements and best practices.

In addition to these features, GitHub Copilot also offers advanced functionality such as code refactoring, which can help developers to simplify and improve their code. This can be particularly useful when working on large and complex projects, as it can help to make the code more maintainable.

To use GitHub Copilot, developers need to have a GitHub account and the GitHub extension for IntelliJ,Pycharm, Visual Studio Code or your favorite IDE . Once the extension is installed, developers can start using Copilot by opening a new file or by hovering over a function or variable.

## ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI that can be used to increase coding productivity. It is a state-of-the-art machine learning model that can be used to generate code, complete code snippets, and even write entire programs.

One of the main benefits of using ChatGPT for coding is its ability to generate code quickly and accurately. With ChatGPT, developers no longer have to spend hours writing code from scratch or searching through documentation to find the right syntax. Instead, they can simply provide ChatGPT with a brief description of what they want to accomplish, and the model will generate the necessary code.

Another benefit of using ChatGPT for coding is its ability to learn from existing code. The model can analyze existing code and use that knowledge to generate new code that is consistent with the existing style and structure. This means that developers no longer have to spend time trying to conform to a specific coding style, as ChatGPT can automatically generate code that follows the style of the existing codebase.

Additionally, ChatGPT can also assist in code refactoring and bug fixing. It can analyze the code, find bugs and suggest fixes, or even generate the fix itself. This can save a lot of time and effort for developers who would otherwise have to manually scan through the code to find and fix bugs.

Another great feature of ChatGPT is its ability to write comments and documentation. This can be extremely helpful for developers who are working on complex projects and need to document their work. ChatGPT can analyze the code and generate comments and documentation that explain what the code is doing and how it works.

Furthermore, ChatGPT is a powerful` tool `that can be used to increase coding` productivity `in several ways. It can generate code quickly and accurately, learn from existing code, assist in code refactoring and bug fixing, write comments and documentation, and even generate entire programs. By incorporating ChatGPT into their workflow, developers can save time and effort while also improving the quality of their work.

On another hand, ChatGPT also has the ability to generate entire programs. It can take a high-level description of what the program should do and generate the entire codebase for it. This can be especially useful for developers who are working on proof-of-concepts or prototypes.

Of course, ChatGPT is no error-proof and due to the stored data, it could be the case that some code or libraries are old and/or deprecated. However, when writing one of the generated errors triggered in suggested blocks of code, ChatGPT will apologize for that and suggest new changes that will work. This is some of the situations several people have encountered. Once Microsoft complete the acquisition and ChatGPT has access to real time data, we will see what this` tool `is capable of.

We have seen that GitHub Copilot is a powerful` tool `that can help developers to increase their` productivity `by reducing the time it takes to complete repetitive or complex tasks. With its ability to provide code suggestions, automatically fix common coding errors and suggest improvements, Copilot can help developers to improve the quality of their code and increase their efficiency.

## A lot of new things to come

All of these features combined can greatly increase coding` productivity `and help developers focus on the more important aspects of their work such as designing and implementing new features, and solving complex problems.

To conclude with this short article AI is already being used to improve software` productivity `in several ways, and it is likely that its use will continue to expand in the future. By automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, AI can help developers to focus on more complex and creative tasks, ultimately leading to better software and more efficient development processes.

We are still on very early stages of the AI revolution. If all this is possible now, imagine what could be done when there is more data available, and we the different training models can be continuously improved in order to improve the loss function and enhance the different predictions. We have not yet seen the real power of AI, and it will still take some time until we are close to it.
