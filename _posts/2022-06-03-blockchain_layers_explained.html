<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    If you have been in the crypto or blockchain scene for some time, you may
    be familiar with the different layers of the blockchain, their functions,
    and how they interact one with another. However, if you are new, you may
    hear terms such as L1 or L2 and you may ask yourself what these words are.
    Don’t worry about this.
</div>
<p>
    In this article we explain not just the different layers but also the
    importance of each of it. It’s also important to note what they mean and
    why some tokens may be correlated because they are part of the same layer.
</p>
<p>
    As it occurs with the OSI and the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) models, we
    also have different layers in blockchains.
    The different OSI layers are: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport,
    Session, Presentation, and Application.
    The ones of the Interest Protocol are just 4: Link, Internet, Transport,
    Application. A similar structure occurs in the Blockchains.
</p>
<p>
    We can distinguish 4 different Blockchain layers, where each one has a
    specific purpose. Each layer is essential and has some defined functions
    and roles. They start with Layer 0 and the last one is Layer 3. In order to
    see the different features, it’s better to see this with some examples.
</p>
<h2>
    Layer 0
</h2>
<p>
    This protocol is where everything starts and the bottom of the different
    blockchain protocols that we see later. It’s like the foundations of the
    building where the different infrastructure, hardware and internet are
    provided. Although, the other layers would be useless without this initial
    layer, it’s also the layer that cannot be seen and sometimes ignored.
</p>
<p>
    They allow interconnectivity and integration between traditional and
    blockchain network.
</p>
<p>
    As mentioned, this is where everything starts. Therefore, they allow other
    blockchains be built upon them and also that different blockchains are
    operable between them. In other words, the chains that are created on the
    layers above are interoperable and compatible thanks to the L0 protocols.
</p>
<p>
    For these characteristics they can be seen as the data transfer layer of
    the OSI model. Without this one, Bitcoin or Ethereum would not be able to
    run. Basically, their objective is to interconnect different chains between
    L1 protocols.

            <h5>L0 Example</h5>
            <h5>PolkaDot: Web3.0 Interoperability</h5>
            <small> The most famous example is probably PolkaDot. The goal of the protocol is
                like the one of a bridge between different L1 blockchains. It allows cross-blockchain transfers of any sort of data or asset, not just
                tokens. Connecting to Polkadot offers users  the potential to interoperate
                with a wide form of blockchains in the Polkadot network.<br>

<h2>
    Layer 1
</h2>
<p>
    Layer 1 blockchains are probably the most famous ones for most of us. They
    are also known as public chains because they have their own structure,
    encryption, algorithms, technology and mechanisms. These are blockchains
    that are used to process transactions on their own blockchain and have
    different utilities.
</p>
<p>
    This protocol consists of the following sublayers: Data layer, Network
    layer, Consensus layer and Activating layer
</p>
<p>
    Since the transactions need to be processed and validated, the famous
    Consensus Mechanism (PoW, PoS, etc.) is also inherent to this layer.
    However, there are also other technical aspects involved such as the block
    time, the different rules and the dispute resolution. In this layer, we
    also see different limitations such as scaling.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="/img/posts/blockchain_layers/algorand.png"  alt="Sustainable and scalable">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Algorand is probably one of the most sustainable blockchain due to the technology and consensus mechanism</span>
</p>
<p>
    The goal of Layer 1 blockchains is to achieve the following 3
    characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Decentralization
    </li>
    <li>
        Security
    </li>
    <li>
        Scalability
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There is a famous term called the Blockchain Trilemma, which says basically
    that basic chains can just achieve 2 out of 3.
</p>
<p>
    In order to achieve the first 2, scalability is sacrificed and left for
    later. It’s here where Layer 2 plays a key role too.
</p>
<p>
    Probably these blockchains are the most famous ones to you. Bitcoin,
    Ethereum, Cardano or Solana are examples of this category and most
    probably.

            <h5>L1 Example</h5>
            <h5>Algorand: Offsetting the Carbon Footprint</h5>
            <small> As opposed to Ethereum, Algorand is a L1 chain, without needing L2
                protocols for scability purposes. This is because the consensus mechanism
                in the Algorand Network is quite different. In this case, a group of
                validators is selected randomly each time, without needing to have the
                majority. Algorand is also known as the Green Blockchain.<br>

<h2>
    Layer 2
</h2>
<p>
    In L1 blockchains, we have seen the Blockchain Trilemma and the problem
    with scalability. Apart from the Blockchain Trilemma Bitcoin and Ethereum
    are getting older and what was valid some years ago it is no longer enough,
    mainly with the increasing number of users. .For example, we have several
    problems in terms of scalability, speed and gas fees. For that reason, the
    purpose of L2 blockchains is to enhance the L1 blockchains, with several
    updates and applications. Via this layer, the processing of the different
    transactions is also increased. This layer is seen as an auxiliary
    extension of the L1 protocol .
</p>
<p>
    For example, Ethereum is only able to process around 10 transactions per
    second. Ethereum is famous for many benefits, but one of the disadvantages
    is the gas fees. When the network is congested, there is a lot of
    competition to process the different transactions and it’s when the gas
    fees considerably increase – the law of supply and demand -. This problem
    is becoming more often because of the adoption of Ethereum and the
    applications within the ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
    What the L2 protocol does is to free up Ethereum (L1) from this work. This
    way, they can process thousands of transactions per second. Ethereum is the
    layer with more L2 protocols.
</p>
<p>
    Ethereum is famous for having many L2 solutions, but it also applies to
    other L1 layers such as Bitcoin.There are some examples for Etherum:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Polygon is one example running on top of Ethereum. The goal of the
        Indian platform is to connect blockchains built on Ethereum.
    </li>
    <li>
        Optimism is also developed for Ethereum in order to improve speed and
        reduce fees in the Ethereum network
    </li>
    <li>
        Immutable X is the second layer protocol used in the NFT Marketplace
        OpenSea (built on ERC-721), that helps also reduce fees when
        transacting in the blockchain.
    </li>
</ul>

            <h5>L2 Example</h5>
            <h5>Lightning Network</h5>
            <small>For the most famous chain, the Lightning Network is a L2 payment protocol layered on top
                of Bitcoin. It permits fast transactions among participating nodes and has
                been proposed as an approach to the bitcoin scalability trouble.<br>

<h2>
    Layer 3
</h2>
<p>
    We have seen that L1 and L2 layers are quite linked to each one, but there
    are many differences between the different blockchains in these layers. The
    reason is that they use completely different technologies and processes.
    The purpose of the third layer is to abstract these differences and make
    the things much easier for the user. With this, the different ecosystems
    are interconnectable and can communicate regardless of the technical
    differences that we can find among them
</p>
<p>
    This is something similar to what’s done in the IP Internet Protocol and
    the application layer. L3 is the protocol that hosts the DApps. These
    applications are related to diverse topics such as DeFi, games, or storage
    apps.
</p>
<p>
    Although Bitcoin is the most known one here, Ethereum is the one that has
    more applications and has a huge ecosystem. The different cases vary across
    sectors:
</p>
<p>
    Ethereum aside, Solana is also famous for having many consolidated
    applications.
</p>
<p>
<h3>
    Examples of dApps
</h3>
<p>
In order to understand the last layer, these are some examples of complete different applications accessible to users.
</p>
</p>
<h4>
    Uniswap (v2 and v3)
</h4>
<p>
    <a href="https://uniswap.org/">
        Uniswap</a> is one of the largest DEXs in the space and is powered by the Ethereum
    blockchain. One of the main differences compared to Binance or Coinbase is
    that Uniswap operates without an order book. Instead, it uses framework to
    provide trading liquidity.
</p>
<h4>
    OpenSea
</h4>
<p>
    <a href="https://opensea.io/">
        OpenSea</a> is the world’s largest Non-Fungible Token marketplace which is
    based on Ethereum ERC-721.

<h4>
    Orca
</h4>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.orca.so/">
        Orca</a> is the first user-friendly cryptocurrency exchange built on Solana. It
    offers minimal fees and latency compared to Ethereum.
</p>
<h4>
    PancakeSwap
</h4>
<p>
    <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/">
       PancakeSwap</a> an be seen as an alternative to UniSwap.
    As this one, is a decentralized exchange, which allows for
    trading cryptocurrencies and tokens without an intermediary, and runs on
    Binance Smart Chain. It is built on an automated market maker system, which
    relies on liquidity pools between token pairs to enable crypto trades.
