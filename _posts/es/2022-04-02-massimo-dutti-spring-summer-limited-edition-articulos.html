<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    Since temperatures go up, we are already in Spring, and we will be soon in
    summer, the fashion companies have started adapting their
    collections.
</div>
<p>
    For that reason, Massimo Dutti, as every almost every year, has launcher
    their limited edition for the Spring Summer, with a clear nod to summer and
    fresh style.
</p>
<p>
    Massimo Dutti presented some days ago (end of March) the Limited Edition
    SS22 and it is already available for purchase. For this time, taking
    advantage of the rising temperatures, the collection is set in the Maghreb
    region.
</p>
<p>
    Since this post is mainly about the different new looks and articles, it
    will be shorter than other post of this website
</p>
<p>
    Coming back to the collection, the campaign photography is made by Josh
    Olins and the thematic for this campaign is linen, nature, and summery
    vibes. That’s why most of the shots are taken in desert landscapes of the
    North African region.
</p>
<p>
    In this collection, Massimo Dutti focuses on the main characteristics, with
    no specific preference:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Purity and nature
    </li>
    <li>
        Sharp silhouettes
    </li>
    <li>
        Natural colors
    </li>
    <li>
        Nods to Craftsmanship
    </li>
    <li>
        Light garments
    </li>
    <li>
        Comfortable fabrics
    </li>
    <li>
        Classic patterns
    </li>
    <li>
        Avant garde point of view
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These attributes are aligned with the brand’s principles and culture. At
    the same time, Massimo Dutti still bets on the look of a sober man with
    classic taste, as well as cosmopolitan and open to change. You can see also
    this culture applied in other campaigns such as the Join Life collections
</p>
<p>
    The preferred materials are also focused on nature and adapt to warmer
    months of the year. That’s why MD has opted for materials such as linen,
    leather, or different blends of knitwear.
</p>
<p>
    Aligned with choice of the materials and landscapes, they try to evoke non
    artificial man. As opposed to other brands, it is difficult that you will
    see synthetic materials in the fabrics, and you will mainly see natural
    fabrics such as the ones mentioned for this collection.
</p>
<h2>
    My favorite pieces of the collection
</h2>
<p>
    In this post, I am selecting the most charismatic and unique pieces from
    this collection. However, I invite you to visit the website to find any
    other garment that could be interesting for you too.
</p>
<h3>
    Navy Blue Linen Blazer
</h3>
<p>
    The pandemic is being normalized and even if some of us are already back in
    the office, I would also expect that progressively most of us have to go to
    the office. For summer months, I remember that it was a nightmare to wear
    suits in hot places such as Spain or Greece. For these specific climates,
    linen suits and blazers may be a good alternative for work and events.
</p>
<p>
    If you go for lighter fabrics and materials, this will fix the problem and
    you will wear the suit or blazer more comfortably as well as a great style.
</p>
<p>
    Single breasted is still the preferred choice for most men. However, this
    double-breasted blazer can be a good item to distinguish from other typical
    suits. You can combine with the trousers of the same blazer or with more
    casual garments such as jeans.
</p>

</p>
<h3>
    Leather toiletry bag
</h3>
<p>
    This collection also adds interesting and high-quality accessories. For
    your home or when you are on trip, it’s a good idea to invest in a good
    toiletry bag.
</p>
<p>
    This one is made on leather with an elegant pattern, and it is big enough
    to put all the things you need before and after shower. For similar items
    from more famous brands, you will pay 5 – 10 times more.
</p>

<h3>
    Suede overshirt
</h3>
<p>
    The next item is delicate, and you should not use it for rainy days.
    However, wearing a suede overshirt will elevate your look. Besides, you can
    also combine this garment in multiple ways. As mentioned, this is the most
    delicate item of the list, but if you have the chance this is a good
    investment for your wardrobe.

<h3>
    Leather Espadrilles
</h3>
<p>
    The known as Alpargatas in Spain, it is a typical product from Spain, used
    in this country, the south of France and some regions of America. Known as
    a humble shoe and evolved from the Egyptian and Roman sandals, Massimo
    Dutti has redesigned this shoe for this collection. This model is kept
    simple, but adds some sophisticated final touches, resembling in some cases
    the woven design of Bottega Venetta.

<h3>
    Beige Shawl collar cardigan
</h3>
<p>
    The weather is getting warmer and drier, but on summer night, we will need
    to add some layers depending on where we are. Wearing a wool or cashmere
    sweater in the months of summer may be excessive. Instead, trusting in
    lighter materials such as cotton would make a great balance. This shawl
    collar cardigan can be the great choice for these cases and as you can see
    the color is also more appropriate for these months.

<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    Normally, I prefer the Autumn / Winter season, since the one for Spring /
    Summer you have less options. In Winter, it is also more common that we
    have more layers and that’s why we have more options to play with.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of the women collection, you will of course have more
    alternatives. However, I’m sure you can find something interesting in this
    collection too.

    We have focused in the 5 most interesting pieces of the collection for me,
