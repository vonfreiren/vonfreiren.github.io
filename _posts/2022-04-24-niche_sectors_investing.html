    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    In previous posts we introduced some investment funds or ETFs focusing on
    specific countries or indexes such as the S&amp;P500 or the Nasdaq. We also
    went further and analyzed some interesting regions with a considerable
    expected growth for the following years.
</p>
<p>
    I have also said that I prefer to focus on these broad investment vehicles
    in order to get the best possible returns with the lowest possible risk,
    due to the diversification that these products offer.
</p>
<p>
    However, this approach may be boring, and we can always allocate some of
    our savings to have some fun, either in the way of cherry picking some
    stocks or in this case with some niche sectors. The idea on selecting these
    specific areas for the ETF, is because we think that there will be a huge
    growth in these sectors in the upcoming years (or in the short-term).
    Depending on our strategy, they help us combine our defensive and
    aggressive options in our portfolio.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the price of a security is composed of the current
    earnings and the estimated growth. This also means that for sectors with a
    high growth, the current price already reflects it.
</p>
<p>
    In any case, these are some of the industries that will create a
    considerable impact in the years to come, and for that reason it may be
    worth to have some of our portfolio destined to any of these sectors.
</p>
<h2>
    Videogames
</h2>
<p>
    When I was young, the video games sector was already important, but it was
    below the movies or the music industry. Today, this industry’s revenue is
    bigger than the one of these two industries combined. The growth has been
    incredible in the last 15 years, but it will for sure not stop there.
</p>
<p>
    While some years ago, most games could not be played online, this activity
    has also changed in the last years, opening new possibilities. For example,
    we have also seen this with the different organizations supporting and
    investing in eSports. New ways of entertainment have been included, giving
    more importance to social or mobile games.
</p>
<p>
    The latest trends such as NFT or the metaverse have also an important role
    on some of these games and the different unique items that the players may
    get. In some cases, the trends could change completely the way we game.
    Therefore, if the growth in the last decade was already impressive, these
    two blockchain phenomenon will help to push the videogames even further.

    <h2>
        Artificial Intelligence
    </h2>
    <p>
        The advance of Artificial Intelligence is unstoppable, as organizations
        are adopting different branches of this technology to boost their
        digital transformation, giving great strength to a market that
        encompasses AI software, hardware, and services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, the application fields of AI range from finance to robot
        control, from image recognition to vehicle driving and much more. We
        can see that big players like Google, Apple, Intel, Amazon, IBM are
        investing massively in the development of this sector. Not long ago,
        Google bough the company DeepMind for $400 million.
    </p>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that seeks
        to bring technology to mimic human behavior. Theorizing of a computer
        mind that mimics the functioning of the human goes back more than half
        a century, in 1956, when the term Artificial Intelligence was
        introduced as part of the Dartmouth Summer Research project.
    </p>
    <p>
        The shift from theory to practice came hand in hand with the rise of
        computer skills. The technological acceleration of recent years has
        allowed the development of increasingly sophisticated and powerful
        algorithms. Today, the application fields of AI range from finance to
        robot control, from image recognition to vehicle driving and much more.
        Big conglomerates like Google, Apple, Intel, Amazon, IBM are investing
        massively in the development of this sector.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to some sources, sales in the next eight years may grow by up
        to 35,570 million dollars, or what is the same, an increase capacity of
        more than 600%. In addition to this astonishing information, investment
        in AI is increasing at a rate of 37% per year and by 2022 it will
        exceed 77 billion dollars, three times more than the current 24
        billion.

    <h2>
        eCommerce
    </h2>
    <p>
        Although eCommerce had been growing steadily for years, COVID-19 was
        the trigger that changed in many cases how we buy different products
        and articles, and in general the shopping experience. Due to the loosen
        restrictions in most countries, the growth has been normalized in 2021,
        but predictions say that eCommerce will be growing every year. Indeed,
        the pandemic helped some people discover that buying could be much
        easier and without any issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some factors helping the growth will be related to mobile phones and
        faster technologies such as 5G. More services such as augmented
        reality, virtual reality, image recognition or artificial intelligence
        will be possible to offer a broader range of possibilities to the
        customer. Besides, almost every company today has an online application
        and from there the user can buy directly almost anything.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, the rise of more payment options such as of
        cryptocurrencies will also be an added benefit to customers wanting to
        buy online.
    </p>
    <p>
        While more senior people were initially reluctant to online shopping,
        younger generations such as the millennials are the early adaptors of
        this trend. This means that this way of buying will be already
        inculcated for the new generations to come and will be seen as
        something completely normal in the everyday life of every customer in a
        few years from now.

    <h2>
        Cannabis
    </h2>
    <p>
        This is a controversial topic in some cases, but the truth is that more
        and more countries are allowing the usage of marijuana for therapeutic
        treatments. I have said that it is a polemic aspect because Cannabis
        has been seen as a criminal or something that should be avoided until
        recently. Although, we need more education on this topic, mainly for
        younger generations. it has been proved that the Marijuana derivative
        medicaments or therapies have multiples benefits in diseases.
        Furthermore, the price of this medication is generally lower compared
        to other alternatives, and it also has less side effects.
    </p>
    <p>
        The US and Canada have been two of the latest countries that have
        approved the usage of Marijuana, and as many things occur, some other
        regions such as Europe or Asia may also follow soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is expected to grow between 2022 and 2030 with an annualized rate of
        25%. Apart from the medical advances, the decriminalization has also an
        important role in this rise.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two factors that will be key for the expansion of the
        Cannabis sector:
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of regulation, it is predicted that more and more countries
        will allow medical treatment with Marijuana or derivatives from this
        drug.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another key aspect is the global population aging. We live more years,
        and because of this, we also suffer from more diseases. In some cases,
        Marijuana can play an important role to mitigate of our life
        expectancy. All in all, Cannabis has the potential to help humankind,
        being part of the different breakthroughs in terms of health.

    <h2>
        Water
    </h2>
    <p>
        Because all these investments don’t have to be necessarily related to
        technological improvements, we refer in this section to one of the
        oldest things in history. We are made for the most part out of water
        and we need water to survive. While people think on electricity or gas
        when investing in different companies, we could survive without these
        two, but water is essential for our survival. Other utilities such as
        oil and gold are also
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately. due to climatic change and other linked problems, water
        is becoming scarcer. Besides, accessing to water in some countries is
        still a nightmare. Out of the total water on earth, 97% is saltwater.,
        and out of the remaining 3%, another percentage is frozen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since we all need water and there is less for all of us, with the
        expected growth of the global population, the more demand and less
        supply means that the value of water will increase.

    <h2>
        Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
        We have described 5 sector that are expected to grow in the years to
        come at cruise speed. Investing in companies that are focused on these
        sectors can add additional diversification to our portfolio, add
        defensive or aggressive variants to it while we have some fun with our
        choice.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are other sectors that were not included in this post, but that
        will grow very much in the next decade. Some of them are the following
        ones: Blockchain, semiconductors or metaverse
    </p>
    <p>
        As mentioned in the introduction, even if they are expected to grow,
        the current price may already reflect the expected expansion and
        development of these industries.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another factor to be noted is liquidity. For example, if you want to
        buy or sell, there may be less options, not just in the form of funds
        or ETFs, but in the number of orders.
    </p>
    <p>
        All in all, there are some advantages and disadvantages when selecting
        niche funds. Therefore, I would not recommend including 100% of your
        portfolio into niche sectors. On the other hand, allocating just some
        of the money into these funds could be a wise and fun option for the
        future.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested on how to access to buy them, an example of
        different funds and ETFs has been included. You can see a list of
        brokers in one of my past articles:
