By incorporating these simple, cost-effective items into your routine, you'll be better equipped to meet the demands of your sport and achieve your performance goals.

Here are six affordable and accessible "doping" items that can give you that extra edge in your cycling and sports endeavors.

## Six affordable foods

### 1\. Gummy Bears

**Why they work:** Gummy bears are a quick source of simple sugars, primarily glucose, which is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. This makes them an excellent source of immediate energy, especially during or after intense exercise.

**Benefits:**

- Quick energy boost to prevent mid-ride fatigue
- Convenient and easy to carry during workouts
- Helps replenish glycogen stores post-exercise

**Usage:** Consume a small handful of gummy bears (about 30-40 grams) during long rides or immediately after intense workouts to replenish your energy levels and maintain performance.

### 2\. Coca-Cola

**Why it works:** Coca-Cola provides a combination of caffeine and sugar, which can work synergistically to improve performance. The caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, while the sugar provides a quick source of energy.

**Benefits:**

- Immediate energy boost and enhanced alertness
- Can help stave off fatigue during endurance activities
- Readily available and easy to consume

**Usage:** Drinking a small can of Coca-Cola (about 150-200 ml) during a long ride or tough workout can give you a quick energy lift. Be mindful of the sugar content and use it strategically.

### 3\. Honey

**Why it works:** Honey is a natural source of carbohydrates, primarily in the form of glucose and fructose, which provide both immediate and sustained energy. It also contains small amounts of vitamins and antioxidants.

**Benefits:**

- Provides a steady release of energy
- Easy to digest and gentle on the stomach
- Natural and unprocessed source of sugar

**Usage:** Take a tablespoon of honey before or during exercise, or mix it into your water bottle for a natural energy drink. It's also great for post-workout recovery when spread on toast or mixed into yogurt.

### 4\. Bananas

**Why they work:** Bananas are rich in potassium, vitamin B6, and carbohydrates, making them an excellent food for sustaining energy and preventing muscle cramps. The natural sugars provide a quick energy boost, while the fiber ensures a slower, more sustained release.

**Benefits:**

- Quick and sustained energy boost
- Helps prevent muscle cramps due to high potassium content
- Convenient and portable snack

**Usage:** Eat a banana about 30 minutes before your workout for a pre-exercise energy boost, or carry one with you to eat during long rides or after intense sessions.

### 5\. Peanut Butter

**Why it works:** Peanut butter is packed with healthy fats, protein, and a moderate amount of carbohydrates. This combination makes it an excellent source of long-lasting energy and aids in muscle recovery.

**Benefits:**

- Provides sustained energy due to its balanced macronutrient profile
- Helps with muscle repair and recovery thanks to its protein content
- Versatile and easy to incorporate into meals or snacks

**Usage:** Spread peanut butter on whole-grain bread or crackers for a pre-workout snack, or enjoy a spoonful with a banana post-workout to aid recovery. It can also be added to smoothies for an extra energy boost.

### Beetroot Juice

**Why it works:** Beetroot juice is rich in nitrates, which your body converts into nitric oxide. This compound helps to relax and widen blood vessels, improving blood flow and oxygen delivery to your muscles.

**Benefits:**

- Increased stamina and endurance
- Improved time-trial performance for cyclists
- Enhanced oxygen uptake during intense exercise

**Usage:** Consuming 500ml of beetroot juice a few hours before your workout can provide noticeable benefits. It's available in various forms, including juice, powder, and concentrated shots.
