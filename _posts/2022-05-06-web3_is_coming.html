<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    If you are already up to date with concepts such as the ones of blockchain,
    DeFi, or metaverse, now is the time to find out about Web3. This term has
    gained traction in 2021 and 2022 and continues to be mentioned in articles
    that discuss about topics such NFTs, cryptocurrencies, or decentralized
    finance. However, Web3 (or Web 3.0) is far more than that as you will see
    below.
</div>
<p>
    On top of the latest trends and news, I see more ads, courses and job
    offers related to Web3. That is related to the growth and how the corporate
    world can benefit from this generation.
</p>
<p>
    Web3 is the third generation of Internet services for web site and
    applications. This concept focuses on the use of machine-based data
    understanding to provide a semantic and data-centric Web. The final goal of
    Web3 is to create smarter, more connected, and more open websites. Not just
    that, but the goal of Web3, as we will see later, is also to give back the
    prominence to the users.
</p>
<p>
    Web3 is not implemented yet, so there is no clear definition about various
    aspects yet. To give you an idea, making the transition from the original
    web, from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, took more than one decade. Nowadays, we are
    still working with Web 2.0 and there may be still years to come until we
    see the full capabilities of Web3.

<h2>
    History of the Internet
</h2>
<p>
    To give you some history about the internet, we can see that each topic for
    each of the Web version:
</p>
<h3>
    Web 1.0
</h3>
<p>
    If the early web, called 1.0, everything worked around hyperlinks. Web 1.0,
    also known as the World Wide Web, appeared first. Some of us will remember
    those days when connecting to the Internet was a still a slow process and
    there were still not many options yet.
</p>
<h3>
    Web 2.0
</h3>
<p>
    Next, we have Web2.0. This one was around social networks. This is the term you have been hearing in the last years with the boom of Facebook, Twitter and other companies.
</p>
<p>
    As more people began to use the Internet, the potential it had was
    understood globally. For this reason, new infrastructures were created to
    promote it. The Internet became faster and allowed for heavier applications
    and websites, which gave rise to the era of social networks and huge
    platforms such as Netflix, YouTube, Facebook, or Amazon.
</p>
<p>
    Today, people from all over the world can share information and be
    entertained, shop, find answers to their questions and interact with each
    other thanks to Web 2.0.
</p>
<h3>
    Web3
</h3>
<p>
    The last generation, Web 3.0, is based on tokens, the digital units of
    exchange for blockchain technologies.
</p>
<p>
    There are already some Web3 examples. On one hand, we have Apple's Siri,
    which
    <strong>
        uses voice recognition techniques and artificial intelligence to bring
        results and perform actions
    </strong>
    . To give us an idea of the improvement that this entails, Webs 1.0 and 2.0
    carry out word-by-word matches of the text in relation to what is published
    on the network. This often brings with it an information bias.
</p>
<p>
    Web3 systems, however, seek contextualized knowledge to help people in
    their searches, pointing to a series of analyses and potentially useful
    information. One of the distinctions of the Web 3.0 search engine is the
    time the user needs to spend navigating through a universe of data to find
    what they really want resolved.
</p>
<p>
    Companies like Amazon, Apple and IBM have been investing heavily in Web 3.0
    technologies. For example, Google Inc. over the last decade has made
    several acquisitions of companies in the Semantic Web area, such as Applied
    Semantics and Metaweb Technologies, Inc, among others.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, not everything will take so long to arrive to our daily
    lives. There are some technologies that will define this new web that are
    already being developed. For example, smart home and home automation
    applications using wireless networks and IoT are examples of how Web3 is
    already impacting technology.
</p>
<p>
    If we go to existing devices: Apple's Siri or Amazonâ€™s Alexa are examples
    of Web3 since they combine artificial intelligence with voice recognition.
    This network is still developing and there is still a long way to go.
    Another important player in Web3 is the Brave Browser and some interesting
    reward mechanisms such as BAT tokens.

<h2>
    Characteristics of Web3
</h2>
<p>
    First, Web 3.0 will be primarily data centric. This data is endless and for
    that reason it is necessary to design an appropriate storage architecture
    and technology. Although Big Data seems to be the way to go, there is still
    research to be done on the most effective use of technology to store and
    manage this data, as privacy issues could arise in the future too.
</p>
<h4>
    Tokenization
</h4>
<p>
    This new web model has many services based on the token economy, so that
    the ownership and control of these services would be distributed among the
    owners of the tokens, who are also users. The tokens, as we know, have
    exchange value, so this means that users can collect these tokens whenever
    they want. Therefore, Web3 and DeFi may also come hand in hand.
</p>
<p>
    What it does seem is that Web 3.0 will be primarily data centric. This data
    is infinite and therefore it is necessary to design an appropriate storage
    architecture and technology. Although Big Data seems to be the way to go,
    there is still a lot of research to be done on the most effective use of
    technology to store data, as privacy issues could arise.
</p>
<h4>
    Robustness
</h4>
<p>
    This network will give creators and users more freedom in general. It will
    ensure that the latter always have control over their online data by using
    decentralized networks. The next version of the Internet is also expected
    to be more reliable given its decentralized nature, which eliminates the
    possibility of a single point of failure
</p>
<h4>
    Democratization
</h4>
<p>
    It does not need to be controlled by a single entity. The largest companies
    may no longer have full control over the Internet. As a result,
    decentralized applications or apps cannot be censored or restricted in any
    way.
</p>
<p>
    What is going on now with Web 2.0 is that users create but it is the
    technology companies that monetize this content
</p>
<h4>
    Customization
</h4>
<p>
    We will also be able to personalize our browsing experience because this
    type of website will be able to understand our preferences and tastes. This
    will also allow us to navigate more productively, focusing on what we are
    really interested in.
</p>
<h4>
    Commerce
</h4>
<p>
    The same way Web3 will help users, this version will also help businesses,
    and this will cause eCommerce to continue growing. Sellers will better
    understand our purchasing needs and will show us those products and
    services that we are interested in buying with the help of artificial
    intelligence. This will allow us to see better, more relevant ads that are
    more likely to be beneficial to us.
</p>
<h4>
    Better connectivity
</h4>
<p>
    In the past years, we have seen cases that because of interruptions in the
    service, we have lost access to some sites or services for hours.
</p>
<p>
    Since the data will be stored in distributed databases by decentralization,
    users will not have to worry about service interruptions or account
    suspensions for technical reasons.
</p>
<h4>
    Decentralization
</h4>
<p>
    As we have commented in the previous point, one of the key characteristics
    of web 3.0 is decentralization. In this new version, the data will be
    connected in a decentralized way, unlike 2.0, in which it is mainly stored
    in centralized places. Therefore, the data will not be kept in the
    datacentres of big corporations anymore.
</p>
<p>
    We saw with the explosion of web 2.0 brings social networks and
    interactivity with the user, which creates most of its content. It is the
    era of companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, creating silo,
    centralized services dependent on these corporations.
</p>
<h2>
    The role of corporations
</h2>
<p>
    The impact of Web 3.0 on companies will take place in different ways. In
    some cases,    <strong>it will make them highly user-centric and more transparent</strong>
    . Everything that was wrong in terms of user data will undergo a radical
    transformation.
</p>
<p>
    Traditional and new businesses alike will welcome Blockchain technology and
    all the possibilities it brings. You will see that your applications will
    receive blockchain updates in which everything will be made public and
    accessible.
</p>
<p>
    Web 3.0 will bring about a major change in how the Internet works by
    focusing on user privacy. In fact, this is a problem that has been
    discussed for a long time but has not been effectively solved.
</p>
<p>
    Web3 uses blockchain technology, unlike Web 2.0, which takes advantage of
    the Internet to develop applications. It is technically safer to store
    customer data on a blockchain as it is decentralized and its use by
    businesses is transparent, thus protecting it from hackers. Some experts
    say the transfer of data ownership to consumers could disrupt the
    technology sector. And this is because many technology companies would lose
    access to the data that has given them a competitive advantage until now.
</p>
<p>
    Also, thanks to blockchain technology, visitors to a website will have a
    more pleasant login experience. Think how many times you have logged into
    websites using your Facebook profile. Blockchain technology employs the
    same principle as Facebook, which already owns the user's information.
    However,
    <strong>
        by using Blockchain, you will be the sole owner of your information.
    </strong>

<h2>
    What's next?
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>To sump up, in Web</strong>
    <strong>3</strong>
    <strong>
        , users will also be able to interact with data thanks to the use of
        artificial intelligence and machine learning technology.
    </strong>
    That is, it will combine the concepts of the Semantic Web with AI.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, the use of artificial intelligence will allow data much
    faster to users and that these data will be more relevant and personified.
    We are starting to see the use of this technology on the Internet
    <strong>
        through algorithms that are used to suggest products or videos to users
        based on their previous searches
    </strong>
    .
</p>
<p>
    However, this will be even more advanced, and we have still to see a wide
    range of new possibilities in the upcoming years.
</p>
<p>
    We could say that with Web3 we come back to where the Internet started and
    the original idea: a decentralized internet, where there is no control from
    central authorities and the power is given back to the users and consumers.
    However, the full potential of Web3 is still to be seen.
