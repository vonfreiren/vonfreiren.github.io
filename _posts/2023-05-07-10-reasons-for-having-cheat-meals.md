## Guilty? No, it's a boost!

We may feel guilty or have bad conscience when having our favorite food on the weekend. However, this meal has been proven, that instead of delaying our progress, it can be a real boost both mentally and physically.

Cheat meals have become a popular trend in the health and fitness industry. A cheat meal is a meal where you consume foods that are typically avoided when following a healthy diet. These meals are usually high in calories, carbohydrates, and fat, and often include foods such as pizza, burgers, fries, ice cream, and other indulgent treats. While cheat meals have been criticized by some health experts for promoting unhealthy eating habits, there are actually several benefits to incorporating cheat meals into your diet. In this article we focus on 10 of them.

### 1. Craving Prevention

When you follow a strict diet, it's natural to experience cravings for your favorite foods. These cravings can be difficult to resist and can eventually lead to binge eating. Incorporating cheat meals into your diet can help to satisfy these cravings and prevent you from breaking the strict diet.

Furthermore, indulging in a cheat meal can help you to feel more satisfied with your diet overall. When you restrict yourself from eating the foods you enjoy, you may feel deprived and unhappy with your diet. This can lead to a lack of motivation to continue with your healthy eating plan. By incorporating cheat meals, you can give yourself a sense of freedom and flexibility in your diet, making it easier to stick to a healthy eating plan in the long run.

It's important to note that cheat meals should be consumed in moderation and not as an excuse to indulge in unhealthy foods all the time. When incorporating cheat meals into your diet, it's essential to balance them with healthy foods and to make sure that you are still meeting your nutritional needs.

### 2. Metabolism Boost

When you follow a low-calorie diet for an extended period, your metabolism can slow down, making it more difficult to lose weight. By consuming a high-calorie cheat meal, you can actually give your metabolism a boost, which can help you to burn more calories and lose weight faster.

One of the benefits of incorporating cheat meals into your diet is that it can boost your metabolism. When you consume a high-calorie cheat meal, your body responds by increasing its metabolic rate. This is because your body needs to burn more calories to digest and process the excess food you have consumed.

When you are following a low-calorie diet for a prolonged period, your metabolism can slow down. This is because your body adjusts to the lower calorie intake by conserving energy and burning fewer calories. This can make it difficult to lose weight and may even lead to weight gain over time.

Incorporating cheat meals into your diet can help to counteract this effect by giving your metabolism a boost. When you consume a high-calorie meal, your body is forced to work harder to digest the excess calories, which can increase your metabolic rate and help you burn more calories throughout the day.

Furthermore, consuming a high-calorie meal can also help to increase the production of certain hormones in your body, such as leptin and thyroid hormones. These hormones play a role in regulating your metabolism and can help to promote weight loss and fat burning.

### 3. Healthy relationship with food

Following a strict diet can be mentally exhausting and can lead to a negative relationship with food. By allowing yourself to indulge in a cheat meal every now and then, you can develop a healthier relationship with food and learn to enjoy it without feeling guilty.

Incorporating cheat meals into your diet can also promote a healthy relationship with food. When you follow a strict diet, it's common to feel guilty or ashamed when you indulge in your favorite foods. This can lead to negative feelings around food and a cycle of restriction and binge eating.

By incorporating cheat meals into your diet, you can learn to enjoy your favorite foods without feeling guilty or ashamed. This can help to break the cycle of restriction and binge eating and promote a healthier relationship with food overall.

### 4. Mental Break

Sticking to a strict diet can be challenging. Incorporating a cheat meal into your routine can provide a much-needed mental break and can help to alleviate stress.

Following a strict diet can be mentally exhausting, especially if you are constantly tracking your food intake and restricting your calorie intake. Incorporating cheat meals into your diet can provide a much-needed mental break and help to reduce the stress and pressure that can come with strict dieting.

When you indulge in a cheat meal, you are giving yourself permission to take a break from the strict rules and restrictions of your diet. This can help to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety and provide a sense of relief and relaxation. It can also help you to maintain a more positive and balanced mindset around food.

### 5. Performance

If you're an athlete or someone who engages in regular physical activity, a cheat meal can actually enhance your performance. The high-calorie meal can provide you with the energy you need to perform at your best, and can help to replenish glycogen stores that are depleted during exercise.

In addition to the other benefits, incorporating cheat meals into your diet can also enhance your physical performance. When you follow a strict diet for a prolonged period, your body can start to feel fatigued and your workouts may suffer as a result. Cheat meals can provide a much-needed boost of energy and fuel to help you perform better during your workouts.

Cheat meals typically contain higher amounts of carbohydrates, which are the body's primary source of energy during exercise. When you consume a high-carbohydrate meal, your body can store the excess energy as glycogen in your muscles and liver. This can help to increase your energy levels and endurance during workouts, allowing you to perform better and longer.

Furthermore, cheat meals can also provide a psychological boost to your workouts. When you allow yourself to indulge in your favorite foods, you may feel more motivated and excited to exercise. This can help to improve your mood and mindset, leading to a more productive and effective workout.

### 6. Plateauing

When you follow the same diet for a prolonged period, your body can adapt to it, causing a plateau in weight loss or muscle gain. Incorporating a cheat meal can shock your system and give it a new challenge, helping you to break through the plateau.

Incorporating cheat meals into your diet can also help to prevent plateauing, which is a common issue that can occur when following a strict diet for an extended period. Eating what you want will help decrease cortisol levels. Plateauing refers to a state where your weight loss or muscle gain progress slows down or comes to a halt, despite continued efforts.

When you follow a strict diet for a prolonged period, your body can adapt to the changes and become more efficient at using the calories you consume. This can lead to a decrease in the rate of weight loss or muscle gain over time. By incorporating cheat meals into your diet, you can disrupt this adaptation process and prevent plateauing.

Cheat meals can help to increase your calorie intake temporarily, which can shock your body and prevent it from becoming too efficient at using the calories you consume. This can help to rev up your metabolism and prevent your weight loss or muscle gain progress from plateauing. Additionally, consuming higher amounts of carbohydrates during a cheat meal can help to increase your leptin levels, a hormone that plays a key role in regulating metabolism and energy balance.

## 7. Adherence

Following a strict diet can be challenging, and many people eventually give up because they feel deprived or restricted. Incorporating cheat meals can make it easier to stick to a healthy diet in the long run, as it provides some flexibility and enjoyment.

Strict diets can be difficult to adhere to in the long term, as they require a high level of discipline and consistency. Many people find it challenging to stick to a strict diet for an extended period, which can lead to feelings of frustration and discouragement.

Incorporating cheat meals into your diet can help to improve adherence by providing a sense of flexibility and balance. When you allow yourself to indulge in your favorite foods from time to time, you are less likely to feel deprived or restricted by your diet. This can make it easier to stick to your healthy eating plan in the long term.

Furthermore, incorporating cheat meals into your diet can also help to prevent binge eating or overeating. When you restrict yourself too much or for too long, you may experience intense cravings for unhealthy foods. This can lead to binge eating episodes, which can set you back in your weight loss or muscle gain progress. By incorporating cheat meals into your diet, you can satisfy your cravings in a controlled and moderate way, reducing the likelihood of binge eating.

### 8. Social outlet

Dieting can often be isolating, especially if you are avoiding social events due to the temptation of unhealthy foods. Incorporating a cheat meal can allow you to participate in social events and enjoy your favorite foods without feeling guilty.

Incorporating cheat meals into your diet can also provide a social outlet and make it easier to enjoy meals with friends and family. When you follow a strict diet, you may feel limited in your food choices and find it difficult to participate in social gatherings that involve food.

By incorporating cheat meals into your diet, you can allow yourself to indulge in your favorite foods without feeling guilty or restricted. This can make it easier to enjoy meals with friends and family without worrying about your diet. Additionally, by having a cheat meal or two planned into your week, you can still stick to your healthy eating plan while enjoying a social life that involves food.

### 9. Better mood

Eating your favorite indulgent foods can release feel-good hormones, such as serotonin, which can boost your mood and improve your overall well-being.

Incorporating cheat meals into your diet can also boost your mood by providing a temporary break from your routine and allowing you to indulge in foods that you enjoy. Eating foods that you like can trigger the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is associated with pleasure and reward. This can lead to feelings of happiness and satisfaction.

Furthermore, cheat meals can also help to reduce stress levels, which can have a positive impact on mood. When you follow a strict diet, it can be stressful to constantly monitor your food intake and avoid certain foods. This can lead to feelings of anxiety and tension. By incorporating cheat meals into your diet, you can reduce the stress associated with following a strict diet and enjoy a temporary break from your routine.

### 10. Nutrient absorption

Consuming a high-calorie cheat meal can stimulate the production of digestive enzymes, making it easier for your body to absorb nutrients from the healthy foods you consume the rest of the time.

Incorporating cheat meals into your diet can also enhance nutrient absorption by promoting the secretion of digestive enzymes. When you eat a cheat meal that contains a variety of foods, your body produces more digestive enzymes to break down and absorb the nutrients from the meal. This can improve your overall nutrient absorption and utilization.

Besides, incorporating cheat meals into your diet can also help to prevent nutritional deficiencies that may arise from following a strict diet. When you follow a strict diet that limits certain food groups or nutrients, you may be at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies over time. By incorporating cheat meals that contain a variety of foods, you can help to ensure that you are getting all of the essential nutrients that your body needs.

## Plan the cheat meal

It's important to note that incorporating cheat meals into your diet should be done strategically and in moderation. Consuming unhealthy foods on a regular basis can have negative effects on your health and fitness goals. To see the benefits of enhancing nutrient absorption, it's essential to balance cheat meals with a healthy and nutritious diet, as well as regular exercise and proper recovery techniques.

Overall, incorporating cheat meals into your diet can provide a variety of benefits, including preventing cravings, boosting metabolism, improving adherence, providing a mental break, enhancing performance, preventing plateauing, providing a social outlet, boosting mood, and enhancing nutrient absorption. As with any dietary change, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional before making any drastic changes to your diet.

However, it's important to note that incorporating cheat meals into your diet should not be used as a license to overindulge in unhealthy foods. To see the benefits of a boosted metabolism, it's essential to balance cheat meals with a healthy and nutritious diet, as well as regular exercise.

In order to avoid this, planning is key and one of the tricks could be defining in your calendar just 1 cheat meal per week maximum. Ideally, if on that day it's when you are very active.
