## More investment compared to other sports

Compared to other sports, starting practicing sports like cycling entails some serious investing. Other sports with similar spending could be golf or skiing. While most people will think on the bike – and they are not wrong – there are other areas where we should look at to start practicing this fascinating sport.. Apart from the 2-wheel vehicle, there are some tools or accessories that are must. Since most people start with Mountain biking, and this modality requires more maintenance and care compared to road bikes, this post focuses mainly on MTB,

The goal of this article is to help those beginners with some useful tools and tricks that are important when you start. Not just from the initial checks or tools to have, but also the accessories and clothes to wear and what the best nutrients are.
<br/><br/>
## Essential tools in your routes


Starting with the tools and components, here are some steps you could follow to get your tools ready for your MTB:


#### 1. Gather all the necessary tools
Make sure you have all the tools you'll need for the ride, such as a multitool, tire levers, a pump or CO2 inflator, and any specific tools for your bike components (e.g. cassette tool, chain tool, etc.). Some of these tools may be too specific and for these cases, Allen keys could be enough in most cases.
#### 2. Check the tools
You have the tools, but before heading out, inspect your tools to ensure they're in good condition and functioning properly. Check that your tire levers aren't cracked or bent, your pump is working, and your multitool isn't missing any pieces.
#### 3. Pack the tools
Organize your tools in a way that makes them easy to access when you need them. You could store them in a saddle bag, frame bag, or hydration pack, or attach them to your bike with a tool roll or strap.
#### 4. Familiarize yourself with the tools
Make sure you know how to use each tool, especially if you're bringing new tools you haven't used before. Practice changing a flat tire or adjusting your brakes before you hit the trail.
#### 5. Bring spare parts
In addition to your tools, bring along spare parts that could be useful in case of a breakdown, such as a spare tube, chain links, and derailleur hanger.

## Always check your bike before a ride

Together with the tools, performing regular checks on your bike before a mountain bike ride is important for ensuring that your bike is in good condition and ready to handle the demands of the trail. Here are some checks you can perform:

#### 6. Check the saddle height and position
Make sure your saddle is at the correct height and angle for your riding style and body type. This will help you ride more efficiently and comfortably. Adjust the saddle height and angle as needed. The magic number here is 0.88. For example, if you inner length is 87 cm, you multiply it by 0.88, to get a height of 76.5 cm. This is the height of the saddle, starting to measure it from the center of the pedallier.
#### 7. Check tire pressure
Proper tire pressure is important for getting good traction and avoiding flats. Check the recommended tire pressure for your bike's tires and use a pump with a pressure gauge to inflate the tires to the correct pressure. Depending on the route you may adjust it.
#### 8. Inspect the tires for wear and damage
Check the tires for any signs of wear or damage, such as cuts or tears in the tread. If the tires are worn or damaged, replace them before your ride. If you fall, also check the bike to make sure that everything is correct.
#### 9. Check the brakes
Make sure the brakes are working properly and are adjusted correctly. Test the brakes before your ride to ensure they're responsive and provide enough stopping power.
#### 10. Check the chain
Inspect the chain for any signs of wear, such as rust or stretching. Lubricate the chain as needed and replace it if it's excessively worn.
#### 11. Check the suspension
If your bike has suspension, check that it's working properly and is set up correctly for your weight and riding style. Adjust the suspension as needed, depending on the elevation, terrain, and your weight.

### 12. Plan your route
This is  not related to the tools, but also consider planning your route before you head out. This will help you avoid getting lost and will give you a better idea of how long your ride will take. You can use a GPS device or a mobile app to plan your route. You can also use a mobile app to track your ride and share your progress with friends and family.

By taking these steps to initialize your tools, you'll be better prepared for any mechanical issues that may arise during your MTB ride. Nobody wants to come back walking with the bike in hand, so these 5 steps are to avoid this. Should you not be able to fix the issue, it's also of the essence to carry your mobile phone and some money with you.

## Apparels and accessories

When it comes to the clothes, this is not about fashion. Choosing the right clothing for mountain biking is essential for both comfort and safety. Here are some tips to help you select appropriate clothing for your MTB ride:

#### 13. Wear moisture-wicking clothing
Mountain biking can be a sweaty activity, so it's important to wear clothes that wick away moisture to keep you dry and comfortable. Look for synthetic or merino wool fabrics that are designed to pull moisture away from your skin. Cyclists don't wear bib shorts and maillots you see in the races for any other reason.
#### 14. Dress in layers
Weather conditions can change quickly when you're out on the trail, so it's a good idea to dress in layers that you can add or remove as needed. Start with a base layer that wicks away moisture, add a mid-layer for warmth, and finish with an outer layer that protects against wind and rain. You will go through many ups and downs and depending on this you will need to adjust your layers.
#### 15. Choose padded shorts
Mountain bike shorts are designed with padded liners to protect your bottom and reduce friction while you're riding. Look for shorts with high-quality padding and a comfortable fit. Don't do this and your ass will suffer the consequences.
#### 16. Wear a helmet
A properly fitting helmet is essential for mountain biking safety. Look for a helmet that meets safety standards and has plenty of ventilation to keep your head cool. Investing in a good helmet to protect our head is one of the most important things. Riding without helmet should be out of the question.
#### 17. Protect your eyes
Dust and debris can fly up from the trail and get in your eyes, so it's important to wear protective eyewear while mountain biking. Look for glasses or goggles that provide full coverage and have lenses that are designed for varying light conditions.
#### 18. Consider gloves
Gloves can help improve your grip on the handlebars and protect your hands in case of a fall. Look for gloves that are designed for mountain biking and have padding in the right places.

#### 19. Elbows and knees
If you are more conservative or you are planning several jumps or very technical areas, yo should also considering adding some protection for your elbows and knewws. This will help you to avoid any injuries.

By selecting appropriate clothing and gear for your mountain bike ride, you'll be better prepared to enjoy your ride safely and comfortably.

Performing these checks before each ride will help ensure that your bike is in good condition and ready for the demands of the trail. It's also a good idea to have your bike serviced regularly by a professional mechanic to address any issues that may be developing.

## Fueling your body


Proper nutrition is essential for sustained energy and endurance during a mountain bike ride. Forget about it and you will not last much riding. Here are some tips to help you plan and pack food for your ride:

#### 20. Eat a balanced meal before your ride
Start your day with a balanced breakfast that includes protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. This will provide you with sustained energy throughout your ride.
#### 21. Pack snacks for the ride
Plan to eat small snacks every 1-2 hours during your ride to keep your energy levels up. Good options include energy bars, trail mix, fruit, and sandwiches.
#### 22. Hydrate properly
Drink plenty of fluids before and during your ride to stay hydrated. Water is essential, but you may also want to bring an electrolyte drink or sports drink to replenish your electrolytes.
#### 23. Pack foods that are easy to eat
Choose foods that are easy to eat while you're riding, such as energy gels, fruit, or drinks. Avoid foods that are difficult to chew or require a lot of prep work.
#### 24. Consider the weather
In hot weather, you may want to pack more water and hydrating foods, such as fruits and vegetables with high water content. In cold weather, you may want to pack more calorie-dense foods, such as nuts and energy bars.
#### 25. Practice your nutrition plan
It's a good idea to practice your nutrition plan during training rides to see what works best for you. Everyone's nutritional needs are different, so experiment with different foods and hydration strategies to find what works best for you.

By planning and packing the right foods for your mountain bike ride, you'll be able to sustain your energy levels and enjoy your ride to the fullest. Nonetheless, this is not done when you are done. For a proper recovery, as soon as you stop, eat additional nutrients and hydrate yourself.

## Usual pain zones

Having talked about clothes and our vehicle, we cannot forget about our body. Mountain biking is a physically demanding activity that can cause soreness or pain in certain areas of the body. If you are starting, ere are some common pain zones experienced by mountain bikers:

#### 26. Hands and wrists
Holding onto the handlebars for extended periods can put pressure on the hands and wrists, causing pain or numbness. This can be prevented by wearing gloves with padding, adjusting the handlebar position, or using grips with more cushioning.

#### 27. Lower back
Mountain biking can put a lot of strain on the lower back, especially during long rides or when riding over rough terrain. This can be prevented by maintaining good posture while riding and doing exercises to strengthen the core muscles. 
#### 28. Neck and shoulders
Looking up to see the trail or hunching over the handlebars for extended periods can cause neck and shoulder pain. This can be prevented by taking breaks to stretch, using a handlebar with a more upright position, or doing exercises to strengthen the neck and shoulder muscles. 
#### 29. Knees
The repetitive motion of pedalling can cause pain in the knees, especially if the bike's fit is not optimized. This can be prevented by adjusting the saddle height and position, using clipless pedals with the proper float, or doing exercises to strengthen the leg muscles. The part of the knee you have the pain in may indicate if the saddle is too high or low.
#### 30. Feet and ankles
The repetitive motion of pedalling can also cause pain in the feet and ankles, especially if the shoes are not properly fitted or if the pedals are not properly adjusted. This can be prevented by using shoes with a stiff sole and proper support, adjusting the pedal cleats, or doing exercises to strengthen the foot and ankle muscles.
