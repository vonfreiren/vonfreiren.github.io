<h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this article we are changing completely the topic and we are introducing 4 online shops where modern men can go for shopping and find the next essential item for their daily activities.</p>
<p>The shops listed here have been included since they are international, and they should be accessible to all or most visitors around the world.&nbsp; They have been on business for several years and apart from the quality, you should always expect a top-notch customer service.</p>
<p>The list has been prepared with the utmost care based on my experience after so many years of shopping in these stores.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading"><a href="https://www.mrporter.com/">Mr Porter</a></h2>
<p>We start the list with a company that was created from to the Net a Porter group, focused on the men apparel. Some years ago, the Net-a-Porter group merged with Yoox and that&rsquo;s why you will see in this page some articles that were available at Mr Porter in previous seasons.</p>
<p>Mr Porter is an online retailer for men fashion. Since the need to put emphasis on the digital world, the application and the website are top quality. They have multiple brands of the most recognizable brands in the world and every year they add new brands (whether they are newcomers to the industry or old players).</p>
<p>Since a few years, they have their own brand: Mr Porter which offers a good quality for the price. Needless to say, that the designs and quality are of the same standards of the other brands listed in this site.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Both website and application offer an outstanding experience</span>
<h3>Key topics</h3>
<p>The most important things to pay attention to for me are:</p>
<p>The exclusive collections just available at Mr Porter. Some of them in the past are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ermenegildo Zegna for Fear of God</li>
<li>Brunello Cuccinelli x Mr Porter</li>
<li>Kingsman, (yes, the ones from the film)</li>
<li>Tom Ford x Mr Porter</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite starting with a few brands, the portfolio of brands and categories is today countless: shoes, bags, art, watches, or sports are other things that you will see in this store.</p>
<p>There is a section called &ldquo;The Journal&rdquo; which is also interesting, introducing other lifestyle topics such as cities or restaurants. What I also like is to receive the news about what&rsquo;s new every week.</p>
<p>The sale season starting end of December and June is one of the most waited periods of the year for many people. &nbsp;In this period, you can have huge discounts on the most reputable brands of the world.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading"><a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/">Uniqlo</a></h2>
<p>We continue with a Japanese which is very famous in this country, but maybe not that much in other regions of the world. Nonetheless, with their current expansion plans, it may not take long until you hear it about Uniqlo more often.</p>
<p>The retailer from Yamaguchi was founded in 1984 and their focus is on clothes that are basic, functional, have good quality, beauty and they have a fair price. On top of these characteristics, they offer good quality and affordable prices. Who wants more?</p>
<p>The designs you will see in this shop (for men and women) are for that reason not innovative in terms of fashion, but they will be modern classics that will last long in terms of quality and design.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Apart from these two attributes, they also combine beauty and collaborate with other top designers</span>
<p></p>
<h3>Key topics</h3>
<p>Apart from the essentials, which offer an excellent price quality relation, one of the other remarkable characteristics from Uniqlo are the collaborations they have at almost every time of the year. They collaborate with different artists and brands.</p>
<p>Some of the most remarkable collections and collaboration are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heattech (Specific technology for cold temperatures)</li>
<li>Uniqlo x <a href="https://www.jwanderson.com/">JW Anderson</a></li>
<li>J+ (<a href="https://www.jilsander.com/">Jil Sander</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you a have a store close to you, it may worth checking it. They have some promotions, where you may receive some free articles and you will have to rate them and publish a review.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading"><a href="https://www.massimodutti.com/">Massimo Dutti</a></h2>
<p>We leave two Spanish brands for the final part of this article. Although the name could indicate that the company is Italian, this is not the case. The brand from Arteixo is one of my favorites when it comes to quality and price. Although the products are made in different parts of the world, it is not strange to see clothes and accessories made in Spain, Portugal or even Italy.</p>
<p>Compared to the sister brands such as Zara, it offers a more classic style, higher quality and the prices are just slightly more expensive than the other fast-fashion brands.</p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/stores/md/lis_01.jpg" alt="Moden classic">
<span class="caption text-muted">Massimo Dutti is synonymous of a classic sophisticated style</span>
<h3>Key topics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Limited edition: Around September and April, you may see special limited edition collections with nice designs.</li>
<li>Personal Tailoring: Since several years, Massimo Dutti has been offering a special service focused on suits and tailoring. The quality of the suits and shirts is above their &ldquo;normal&rdquo; ones, and I would suggest going for this option.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of leather items, they are also very good such as bags and other wallets or mobile cases. In terms of sale season, although the price is already quite affordable, you may also see some aggressive discounts too.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading"><a href="https://www.meermin.com/">Meermin</a></h2>
<p>Since we are talking about leather items, we stay in Spain, but we close our journey to the Mediterranean Sea. More specifically. we stay in the town of Inca in Mallorca.</p>
<p>This online shop is not about clothes, but shoes. You will be different classic shoes such as: oxford, brogues, boots or buckles at very good price ranges.</p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/stores/me/me.jpg" alt="MTO groups">
<span class="caption text-muted">MTO groups are an original idea from Meermin</span>
<h3>Key topics</h3>
<p>Apart from the quality and prices, something I really like are the MTO (Mate to Order) groups.</p>
<p>For a specific period, there are some specific models available. These shoes will be unique because they will not be available again. The process is based on the crowdfunding model for which the customers decide which shoe model is produced. In order to fund the shoes, the 100% of the goal must be reached.</p>
<p>Please note that since the prices are already too competitive. It is not common that you will see sales or special orders here, as in the previous three stores we described above.</p>
<p>If you prefer to try the shoes physically, there a few stores in the word: Madrid, Paris, and New York. Otherwise, they send order to almost every part of the world.</p>
<p>With these 4 stores we conclude today&rsquo;s story. However, it will not take long until I present you another 4 stores I use and buy from.</p>
