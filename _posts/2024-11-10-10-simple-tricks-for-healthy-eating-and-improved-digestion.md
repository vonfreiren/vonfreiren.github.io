## The Importance of digestive health

Maintaining a healthy diet and proper digestion is crucial for overall well-being. Our digestive systems play a central role in absorbing nutrients from the food we eat, and when our digestive health is compromised, it can lead to various discomforts such as bloating, indigestion, and constipation. Fortunately, there are simple, effective strategies you can implement to improve digestion, support nutrient absorption, and feel better overall. Here are 10 science-backed tricks for healthier eating and improved digestion that you can start incorporating into your lifestyle today.

These are 10 tricks for healthy eating and improved digestion:

### 1. Use Smaller Plates to Control Portions
   One of the most effective tricks to control portion sizes and improve digestion is using smaller plates. Many of us fall into the trap of eating large portions because we’re conditioned to clean our plates. This leads to overeating, which can stress the digestive system, potentially causing discomfort or sluggish digestion. By using smaller plates, you can visually trick your brain into thinking you’re eating a full plate of food, even when you’re eating a smaller amount. This simple change can lead to better portion control, helping to maintain a healthy weight and promoting better digestion.

Research shows that when we use larger plates, we tend to serve ourselves more food, leading to increased calorie consumption. Using smaller plates helps reduce overall calorie intake, which can prevent overloading the digestive system with excess food and give your stomach time to process the nutrients more efficiently.

### 2. Drink Water Before Meals
   Hydration is a key component of healthy digestion. Drinking water before meals can support digestion by preparing the stomach for food. Water aids in the production of gastric juices and helps the body break down food more easily. In addition, water can help your stomach feel fuller, which might prevent overeating during meals. A glass of water consumed 20-30 minutes before eating can aid digestion, regulate appetite, and prepare your body for the digestive process.

However, it’s important to avoid drinking too much water during meals. Drinking excessive amounts of water while eating can dilute stomach acid and digestive enzymes, potentially hindering the breakdown of food. Instead, try to focus on hydrating in the time leading up to the meal and drink small sips of water during meals as needed.

### 3. Apple Cider Vinegar to Boost Digestive Health
   Apple cider vinegar (ACV) has long been hailed for its potential digestive benefits. It is believed to increase stomach acidity, which can aid in the breakdown of food, especially proteins, and improve nutrient absorption. The acidic nature of ACV helps stimulate the production of gastric juices, making it easier for your stomach to digest food effectively.

To take advantage of its digestive benefits, mix one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with a glass of water and drink it about 20 minutes before a meal. This practice can also help curb indigestion, bloating, and acid reflux. Be sure to choose organic, unfiltered apple cider vinegar with the “mother,” as it contains beneficial bacteria and enzymes that promote gut health.

### 4. Chew Your Food Slowly and Mindfully
   The act of chewing food properly is an often-overlooked aspect of digestion. Digestion begins in the mouth, where food is broken down into smaller pieces and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that help with the digestion of carbohydrates. Eating too quickly can prevent thorough chewing, leading to larger food particles that can be more difficult for the stomach to process.

By slowing down and chewing your food thoroughly, you give your digestive system a head start. Studies have shown that eating more slowly can improve digestion, enhance nutrient absorption, and even reduce bloating. Mindful eating also helps your body signal when it is full, reducing the likelihood of overeating.

A good rule of thumb is to chew each bite 20-30 times before swallowing. This practice helps break down food into smaller particles that are easier to digest, promotes saliva production, and reduces the strain on your stomach and intestines.

### 5. Incorporate Probiotic-Rich Foods
   Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that support the health of your gut microbiome, the diverse community of microorganisms in your digestive tract. These bacteria play an essential role in digestion by breaking down food, producing essential nutrients, and protecting the digestive tract from harmful bacteria.

Including probiotic-rich foods in your diet can significantly improve digestion. Foods such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, and kombucha are excellent sources of probiotics. These foods help maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria, which in turn supports optimal digestion, reduces the likelihood of digestive issues like bloating and constipation, and enhances nutrient absorption.

Adding probiotics to your meals can be as simple as having a serving of yogurt or kefir in the morning or incorporating fermented vegetables like sauerkraut or kimchi into lunch or dinner. Regularly consuming probiotics can also improve immune function and may even enhance your mood, as gut health is closely linked to mental health.

### 6. Add Fiber to Your Diet
   Fiber is one of the most important components of a healthy diet, particularly when it comes to digestion. Fiber plays a vital role in maintaining regular bowel movements, preventing constipation, and supporting overall gut health. It adds bulk to the stool, making it easier to pass through the intestines, and it also helps regulate blood sugar levels and reduce inflammation in the digestive system.

There are two types of fiber: soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber dissolves in water and forms a gel-like substance that helps lower cholesterol and regulate blood sugar levels. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to stool and helps prevent constipation by speeding up the passage of food and waste through the digestive tract.

To increase your fiber intake, aim to include a variety of high-fiber foods in your diet. Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts are all excellent sources of fiber. Aim for at least 25-30 grams of fiber per day to support optimal digestive function.

### 7. Avoid Eating Late at Night
   Eating large meals or snacking late at night can interfere with digestion and disrupt your sleep. When you eat late, your body has to work hard to digest food, which can lead to indigestion, acid reflux, or bloating. The body’s metabolism naturally slows down in the evening, so eating heavy meals late at night can overwhelm the digestive system.

To allow your body enough time to digest before sleep, aim to finish eating at least 2-3 hours before bed. This will give your stomach time to process the food and prevent discomfort during the night. If you feel hungry before bed, opt for a light, easily digestible snack such as a small serving of fruit or a handful of nuts.

### 8. Drink Herbal Teas for Digestive Relief
   Certain herbal teas can provide soothing effects on the digestive system and help alleviate discomforts like bloating, indigestion, and nausea. Peppermint tea is well-known for its ability to relax the muscles of the digestive tract, reducing bloating and cramping. Ginger tea is another excellent choice, as it promotes the production of bile and supports the movement of food through the intestines. Chamomile tea can also help calm the digestive system and reduce inflammation.

Drinking a warm cup of herbal tea after meals can help relieve digestive discomfort and promote the smooth flow of digestion. It’s an easy, natural remedy that can be incorporated into your daily routine.

### 9. Incorporate Healthy Fats into Your Diet
   While fat has been demonized in some diets, healthy fats are essential for proper digestion. Healthy fats, such as those found in avocados, olive oil, nuts, and seeds, support the digestive process by stimulating the production of bile, a substance that helps break down fats and fat-soluble vitamins in the digestive tract.

These fats also help the body absorb essential fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D, E, and K, which are important for maintaining overall health. Including healthy fats in your meals can promote optimal digestion, support nutrient absorption, and provide long-lasting energy.

### 10. Exercise Regularly

Exercise is a key factor in promoting healthy digestion. Physical activity stimulates the muscles of the digestive tract, helping to move food through the stomach and intestines more efficiently. Regular exercise can help reduce bloating, alleviate constipation, and improve overall gut health. It can also reduce stress, which is a common trigger for digestive issues such as acid reflux and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise each day. Activities such as walking, cycling, swimming, and yoga are excellent choices for promoting digestive health. Regular exercise can also improve overall health, boost mood, and increase energy levels.

## Conclusion
Improving digestion and maintaining a healthy diet doesn’t have to be complicated or require drastic changes. By incorporating these simple yet effective tricks into your daily routine, you can make a significant impact on your digestive health and overall well-being. From using smaller plates to help control portion sizes, to drinking water before meals to support digestion, each of these practices can be seamlessly integrated into your lifestyle. Over time, these adjustments can enhance nutrient absorption, prevent discomfort such as bloating and indigestion, and keep your digestive system functioning optimally.

Healthy digestion is the cornerstone of good health, as it affects not just how we process and absorb food, but also how efficiently our body detoxifies, absorbs vitamins and minerals, and supports our immune system. By including probiotic-rich foods, such as yogurt and kimchi, you can enhance the beneficial bacteria in your gut, helping to balance your microbiome and strengthen your immune defenses. Increasing fiber intake from whole grains, vegetables, and legumes can also ensure that your digestive tract remains well-functioning, reducing the risk of constipation and other digestive disorders.

Furthermore, adopting mindful eating practices, like chewing food slowly and avoiding late-night meals, allows your digestive system to work more efficiently and helps prevent overloading it with unnecessary stress. By giving your body time to properly digest food before bedtime, you also improve sleep quality, which in turn enhances the body’s natural repair and detoxification processes.

Incorporating healthy fats into your diet from sources like avocados, olive oil, and nuts can further support digestion by aiding the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and promoting the production of bile, which is essential for fat digestion.
