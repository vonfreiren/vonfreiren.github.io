## The health problem of our century

It's understandable that after a long day of work, the temptation to indulge in some tasty but unhealthy junk food can be strong.

However, it's also common knowledge, that giving in to these temptations can have negative effects on both your body and mind.

Consuming excessive amounts of junk food can lead to weight gain, increased risk of chronic diseases, and a host of other health problems. Additionally, the high levels of sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats found in junk food can contribute to mood swings, fatigue, and decreased mental clarity.

However, in our society and with an easier access to different products, avoiding falling in the trap of junk food may be difficult. Fortunately, there are strategies you can use to avoid falling into the trap of junk food. By making small changes to your eating habits and lifestyle, you can cultivate healthier habits and avoid the negative consequences of consuming junk food.

## Tricks to incorporate on your diet


### 1. Plan your meals

Plan your meals ahead of time, so you know what you will eat and when. This will help you avoid the temptation to grab something quick and unhealthy.

How to do this? You can for example choose one day of the week and define what the meal be on each day. Of course, there may be some days you are not home for some of the planned meals due to plans in the last time. One of the best times may be Sunday evening when you plan other things for the start to the week.

Depending on your objective, you can select and play with different ingredients to build the best options for you. Rely on classics or try new things and exotic food. It's completely up to you.

### 2. Make healthy snacks readily available

Keep healthy snacks, like fresh fruit, vegetables, and nuts, readily available so you can reach for them instead of junk food when hunger strikes.

It may look easy, but it is not. However, one trick is to have healthy snacks at hand and don't wait to take a bit regardless of your hungriness. Having several of them during the day, does not just speed up your metabolism but also adds to the sensation of "satiety".

### 3. Avoid keeping junk food in the house

If you don't have junk food in the house, you won't be tempted to eat it. Instead, stock up on healthy foods that you enjoy.

If you cannot see it and you don't have access to it, it's not possible to. If you buy it for "just in case" it is likely that you will use fall in temptation. Therefore, the tip here is just don't buy food that is unhealth for a future occasion. You will probably eat it tonight.

### 4. Choose healthier options when eating out

When eating out, choose healthier options, like salads, grilled chicken, and steamed vegetables, instead of fast food or fried foods.

This may be more difficult to do when seeing the choice of your companion in the restaurant. However, don't use an excuse. If the dish in front of you looks very tasty, go of it instead of just regretting it. On the other hand, you may also compensate with healthier side dishes like salad instead of French fries for instance.

### 5.  Moderation

Nobody is perfect, not even the modern man-It's okay to indulge in junk food occasionally, but it's important to practice moderation. Enjoy your favorite treats in small portions and limit how often you eat them.

### 6. balanced meals 

Eating balanced meals that include a variety of nutrients will help keep you full and satisfied, reducing the temptation to snack on junk food.

Carbs are not the devil, same as fat. Having a combination of nutrients and mix of proteins, healthy fats and carbs (complex carbs) will help you with this task.

### 7. Read food labels 

Read the labels of packaged foods to check for added sugars, saturated and trans fats, and other unhealthy ingredients. Choose foods with fewer of these ingredients.

First rule of thumb is doesn't rely on the appearance or the "envelope". I said that you should read the labels to know what you eat, but this is not true, and it does not need to be that complex. There are some cool applications such as Yuka. They will tell you the score based on the nutrients and additives.

It will be also better to go for products without any QR code, which means that they are 100% natural products.

### 8. Drink plenty of water 

Drinking water can help curb your appetite and prevent you from reaching for junk food.

Aim to drink at least 8 cups of water per day. In summer, the amount of water also should in general increase, especially if you work out regularly.

### 9. Find healthy substitutes 

Instead of reaching for junk food, find healthy substitutes for your favorite snacks. These are some examples.

### Healthy substitutes

- Instead of ice cream, try frozen yogurt or a fruit smoothie.
- Instead of candy, try fresh fruit or a small handful of nuts.

### 10. Practice mindful eating 

Pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues and eat slowly, savoring each bite. This can help prevent overeating and reduce cravings for unhealthy foods. This may be the most difficult of all the items in the list.

Before eating, take a few deep breaths to help you relax and become present in the moment. Don't eat because of anxiety of boredom.

Notice your hunger level on a scale of 1-10. Aim to start eating when you are at a 3-4, and stop eating when you are at a 6-7.

Take small bites and chew your food slowly, savoring the taste, texture, and aroma of each bite.

Avoid distractions such as watching TV, using your phone, or working while you eat. Instead, focus on the experience of eating and the enjoyment of the food. This way, Put down your utensils or food between bites, and take a few moments to check in with your body and assess your hunger level. These steps Will make you conscious of the activity and eat just what you need.

## Starting it progressively

Probably some of these tricks are already known to you and you don't need to start from scratch.

Starting gradually and making small changes over time is a great way to achieve long-term success with healthy eating habits. It's important to remember that making healthy choices is a journey, not a destination, and it's okay to start small and work your way up.

Don't be discouraged if you slip up and indulge in unhealthy foods from time to time. Instead, focus on progress rather than perfection, and make a conscious effort to get back on track with your healthy eating habits as soon as possible.

By taking a gradual approach to healthy eating, you can make sustainable changes that will benefit your overall health and well-being. And remember, the benefits of healthy eating go beyond just physical health - feeling good about yourself can have a positive impact on all areas of your life, from work to relationships to daily activities.

Making lasting changes to your eating habits can take time and patience, but the benefits are well worth the effort. By starting small and gradually incorporating healthier choices into your diet, you can build momentum and create a sustainable healthy lifestyle.

It's important to approach healthy eating as a journey, rather than a quick fix or a temporary diet. This mindset can help you stay motivated and committed to making long-term changes that will benefit your overall health and well-being.

Remember, healthy eating is not about deprivation or perfection. It's about finding a balance that works for you and your body, and making conscious choices that support your health and happiness. So be kind to yourself, celebrate your progress, and keep moving forward towards a healthier, happier you.
