<h1>
    Introduction
</h1>
<p>
    This is my first post in this blog, and I would like to address to a topic
    I may come back in the future to people without much time to analyse the
    different financial options for their future.
</p>
<p>
    Nowadays, the future economic outcome is a constant headache for many
    people across several countries: inflation, economic recovery, pensions,
    etc.
</p>
<p>
    There are many options out there for each type of investor: shares, bonds,
    real estate, crypto currencies, gold, etc. Each person has his preferences
    and depending on the age/risk-aversion different options can be multiple.
</p>
<p>
    More sophisticated investors are not discovering anything new about this
    story. If you continue reading, I am focusing on what I think is the best
    for most people, with the least possible risk: the indexed funds or
    exchange-traded funds.
</p>
<h1>
    Passive funds: Index funds &amp; Exchange Traded Fund
</h1>
<p>
    The behaviour for index funds and ETF is similar. Both replicate an index
    or basket of assets, meaning that with one single instrument you gain
    exposure to multiple securities (e.g., S&amp;P 500 companies). Between
    those, the main difference is that ETFs are traded in real-time, whereas
    the funds are just redeemed at the end of the day. The fees for the ETFs
    tend to be slightly lower too. On the other hand, they are subject to
    transaction fees, but many brokers offer transactions on the most popular
    ETFs for free.
</p>
<p>
    For a person without knowledge and looking for long-term returns, I am of
    the opinion of using a broad index and not a niche funds, which are focused
    a specific sector (e.g., eCommerce, video games, etc). Furthermore,
    although previous returns do not guarantee future returns, in the long-run
    most indexed funds outperform actively managed funds. The latter ones are
    famous for high fees, and although they may outperform passive funds in
    short periods, this is normally not the case in the long run. If you want
    to dig deeper, there are some formulas that determine the performance of
    the fund: For example: The Sharpe or Trentino ratio.

<h1>
    Some examples
</h1>
<p>
    Depending on your risk-aversion, you may choose different funds depending
    on the allocation. People near the retirement age should be more
    conservative. The way to do in this case is focusing on bond funds, which
    are less risky than equities.
</p>
<p>
    A famous rule is the “100 – age” rule. The result should be the amount of
    your portfolio invested on share funds. However, given the current
    situation, if you are young, there should not be problem on having a 100%
    equities asset location.
</p>
<p>
    Below, there is a list with the most famous ones for different profiles.
</p>
<h2>
    SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF Trust
</h2>
<p>
    Probably the most known ETF, which tracks the performance of the S&amp;P
    500 index. This is also the one with less expense ratio. It is considered
    one of the benchmarks.

</p>
<h2>
    Invesco QQQ Trust℠, Series 1
</h2>
<ul>
    <li align="center">
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This ETF tracks the Nasdaq 100 index (non-financial companies) and it is
    riskier than the SPDR. Taking into account the returns from the past 15
    years, it is the best performing large-cap growth funds.

</p>
<h2>
    Vanguard Global Stock
</h2>
<p>
    This fund tracks the MSCI World Index (around 1,500 shares). Almost 70% of
    the exposure of the fund is in the United States with almost 70% of the
    fund. The second largest market is Japan with around 6%.

    </a>
</p>
<h2>
    Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Admiral Shares
</h2>
<p>
    For more conservative investors, we have this fund, which focuses on U.S.
    bonds (Treasuries and Mortgage-backed-securities). The returns are lower
    compared to the other 4 funds analyzed here, but it is also less risky.
</p>

    </a>
</p>
<h2>
    iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF
</h2>
<p>
    This is an ETF tracking the equities from companies located in Emerging
    markets (China, Brazil, India, etc.) For that reason, the fund is
    considered riskier than those included above. Furthermore, the expense
    ratio is also higher in these funds tracking shares from emerging markets.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    Please note that depending on the location, you may not be able to access
    some of these (e.g., most European investors do not have access to US
    funds). However, you should always be able to find similar funds to these.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the ones listed above are ETF or index funds, but you may always
    find the equivalent depending on your preferences. In these cases, the
    expense ratio is considerably low. The more specific you go (e.g. specific
    sector) the higher the expense ratio tends to be .In my case, my preference
    is the ETF because the expense ratios are slightly cheaper and you can
    track the price as in the case of shares.

</p>
<h1>
    The impact of currency
</h1>
<p>
    Although the USD has been dominating for many years, nobody knows when
    other contenders may appear. For the long-term, the recommendation would be
    to pick up an ETF or fund quoted in your local currency.
</p>
<h1>
    One-shot versus Dollar cost averaging
</h1>
<p>
    From my experience, the most dificult process is starting to invest, making
    sure that is it the right time. For this reason, although there are
    different studies showing that one-shot gives on average better results
    (time in the market beats timing the market), most people would not be
    comfortable dumping all the savings in one single transaction.
</p>
<p>
    For that reason, the Dollar Cost Averaging is the preferred method for
    common investors. By using this method, whatever happens in the market, you
    buy every month the same amount of units/shares of the chosen fund.
</p>
<p>
     
</p>
<h1>
    Tax implications
</h1>
<p>
    The way you are taxed on the returns from investment funds may have a huge
    impact. The main difference is whether the fund/ETF is an accumulation or
    distributing investment vehicle.
</p>
<p>
    In accumulation funds, the dividends received from the fund are reinvested.
    While this event is not seen as taxable for investors in many countries, it
    is seen as taxable for investors resident in countries such as Germany or
    Switzerland. Please consider that may be also other rules: For example, in
    Norway, the tax rate differs depending on whether the fund is an equity
    fund or a fixed-income fund. Therefore, please consider your situation in
    advance before choosing a specific fund.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, depending on the country you may want to look at what options are
    best for you. Furthermore, there are some tax-savings accounts in some
    countries that may be useful to make sure that you get benefited from the
    best product-
</p>
<p>
    Together with the expenses and commissions, taxes may be the most important
    factor eating your total returns. Imagine that you are paying 25% of tax in
    the dividends you receive. You are already not receiving this money, and
    more importantly, this amount is not used for the compounding, which
    reduced considerably the future value of the fund.
</p>
<p>

<h1>
    Where to start
</h1>
<p>
    Now that we have seen the theory, it is time to jump into the action.
    Depending on the location you may have just access just to some brokers.
    Here are some examples where you may start investing in some ETFs or
    investment funds.
