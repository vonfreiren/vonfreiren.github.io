<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="text-article">The emerging markets had the worst decade since the 30&rsquo;s in 2020 and 2021 was not much
    better compared to
    previous years. In 2022, we are seeing some minor improvements in these markets. But is there any hope for countries
    composing the emerging countries?
</div>
<p>Here are some reasons to think that something is changing quietly to some of these markets or regions.</p>
<p>With the current interest rate policies from the ECB or the Federal Reserve, the currencies from the analyzed
    emerging countries are now more competitive compared to previous years. Further, they have avoided borrowing and
    increasing their national debt.</p>
<p>While western developed countries (US and Europe) are focused on conflicts, emerging countries have the time to focus
    on economy.</p>
<p>Apart from these common advantages, these are 5 of the emerging countries that will play&nbsp;an important role in
    the years to come.</p>
<h2>1. Vietnam</h2>
<p>An underdog and unknown by many in terms of financial markets, Vietnam is silently growing and leaving some analysts
    with the mouth open.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Vietnam was one of the poorest countries in the world. However, since the reform of the Đổi Mới in the
    80s, the growth has been stellar and there are several reasons to believe that this growth will continue</p>
<p>With the recent Covid and other situations, Vietnam is one of the fastest growing countries. For example, in 2020,
    Vietnam&rsquo;s economy was the best perform amongst all Asian countries. and its objective by 2045 is to be a
    high-income country. In order to achieve this objective, the population is expected to grow by 10% during this time,
    which will of course help with this goal</p>

</p>
<h2>2. Philippines</h2>
<p>By 2050, Philippines is expected to have a population of around 150 million. It is at that time, when it is expected
    that Philippines will be in the Top 15 economies of the world. Philippines did not grow much until the 21st century.
    However, the growth has been fast in the last two decades, focusing on the services sector. Due to these reasons, it
    has become one of the rising tigers in the Pacific region.</p>
<p>Some of the reasoning for this growth is that Philippines has a young workforce, the population speaks English and
    the household debt that is low compared to other countries in Asia and the rest of the world.</p>

<h2>3. Thailand</h2>
<p>Not long ago, Thailand was in the list of undeveloped countries, as some of the countries listed in this article.
    However, since the 80&rsquo;s, its economy grew almost at a rate of 10%. This was until the financial crisis of
    1997-1998 and 2007-2008. Ever, since the growth has been not that high, but still acceptable and better than the
    ones of countries in this region.</p>
<p>One of the obstacles is that Thailand has a military government and the instability has been a negative factor during
    the 21st century. On the other hand, the strategic plan for the next years, called Thailand 4.0, has put emphasis on
    the transformation of the country into a more modern country by focusing on hi-tech companies and services. In this
    new era, the technology and the private sector will play an important role in the country&rsquo;s digital
    transformation that will push and bolster the country&rsquo;s economy.</p>

</p>


<h2>4. China</h2>
<p>It should not be a surprise seeing China in this list. On the other hand, China was the second-worst performing
    emerging market in 2021. Some reasons are the regulations and isolation affecting some of the most important
    technology companies and other big conglomerates. The economic has grown more slowly in the past year, raising some
    alerts.</p>
<p>In the long term, one thing that is common knowledge is that the goal of China is to dominate the world economically.
    It is expected that China be the number 1 economy by 2030, overtaking USA. China may be facing some conflicts or
    obstacles that delay this forecast. However, China knows that they should remain prudent since they don&rsquo;t want
    to be the new hegemony over a devastated world.</p>
<p>They have the potential to do so in the upcoming years. Furthermore, while other developed countries were struggling,
    they have been using different techniques in the recent years: investment in high-tech, R&amp;D, purchase of debt
    from foreign countries, etc. There is no doubt China will be in the contenders list.</p>

                    The investment seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI China Index. The fund generally
                    will
                    invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities of the underlying index and in
                    investments
                    that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of
                    the
                    underlying index. The index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index designed
                    to
                    measure the performance of equity securities in the top 85% in market capitalization of the Chinese
                    equity securities markets, as represented by the H-shares and B-shares markets. The fund is
                    non-diversified.<br>

<h2>5. India</h2>
<p>While different superpowers are engaged in different conflicts or crisis, the sleeping giant India remains
    silent.</p>
<p>With the economic policy changes introduced at the beginning of the 90s, India has been constantly growing every
    year. Furthermore, this growth is expected to continue at least for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>The growth is expected thanks to diverse factors such as population, urbanization, technology, private sector. For
    example, less than 10% of the companies are public. Another advantage compared to countries in this region is that
    India has inherited the British law system. This means, that regardless of the origin, all investors have the same
    rights - opposed for example to China -.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, although China is the most populated country today, there are some fertility issues in the Asian
    country. With this decrease in population in China and the increase in India, it is expected that India will be the
    most populated country in 30 years.</p>
<p>If the CEOs from the most important companies in the world are from Indian origin, why this cannot be replicated to
    the different companies in India?</p>

                    as
