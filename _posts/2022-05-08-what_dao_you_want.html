<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    You have been probably hearing the term DAO for some time, but some topics may
    not be clear yet to you. A DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous
    Organization. In other words, it is an organization that is controlled
    by algorithms or smart contracts, it is not bound by any particular law
    since it is controlled by a blockchain and smart contracts. In other
    words, what it is looking for is to get rid of intermediaries, just as
    bitcoin did when it was created more than 10 years ago. The purpose of
    a DAO is also the one for a company or an institution to be able to
    function without hierarchical management.
</p>
<p>
    To give you an example, bitcoin can be considered a primitive DAO,
    since it works with a series of given rules, is autonomous, and is
    managed in a decentralized way following a consensus protocol.
    Although, the use of Smart contracts, typical of DAOs, did not reach
    the Ethereum platform, which allowed their creation, and has given them
    their current structure.
</p>
<p>
    Initially, Bitcoin was considered the first fully functional DAO, as it
    has a set of pre-programmed rules, works autonomously, and is
    coordinated through a distributed consensus protocol. Since then, the
    use of smart contracts and dApps has been made possible by the Ethereum
    platform, which has brought the creation of DAOs closer to the general
    public and shaped their current look.
</p>
<h2>
    How it works
</h2>
<p>
    The launch of development of a DAO is composed of 3 different steps easy to understand. This is how DAOs work and the distinct phases before it becomes totally decentralized.
</p>
<h3>
    First phase
</h3>
<p>
    The first phase is setting the rules according to which it will work.
    Those rules are codes as a smart contract, existing autonomously on the
    Internet, but at the same time requiring developers to perform some
    specific tasks.
</p>
<h3>
    Second phase
</h3>
<p>
    Once the rules are established, the next phase is the financing phase.
    This is a very important milestone part for two reasons. First of all,
    a DAO has to have some kind of internal property. In this case, these
    are tokens that can be spent by the organization or used to reward
    certain activities within it.
</p>
<p>
    Second, by investing in a DAO, users gain voting rights, as if they
    owned the shares of a company. Consequently, you can give your opinion
    and take part in the decisions of the DAO.
</p>
<h3>
    Third phase
</h3>
<p>
    Once the funding period ends and a DAO is deployed, it becomes a fully
    autonomous body and completely independent from its creators, as well
    as from anyone else. They are open-source, which means their code can
    be viewed by anyone. Also, all financial rules and transactions are
    recorded on the blockchain. This makes DAOs transparent, immutable, and
    incorruptible.
</p>
<p>
    Once the DAO is up and running, all decisions about where and how to
    spend your funds are made by consensus. Everyone who bought a stake in
    a DAO can make proposals about its future. To prevent the network from
    being spammed with proposals, a monetary deposit may be required to
    submit such a proposal.
</p>
<p>
    Subsequently, the interested parties vote on the proposal. To perform
    any action, the majority needs to agree to do it. The percentage
    required to reach that majority may vary depending on each DAO, as may
    be specified in its code.
</p>
<p>
    Essentially, DAOs allow people to exchange their funds with anyone in
    the world. This can be done in the form of an investment, a charitable
    donation, fundraisers, loans, etc. all without a middleman. One
    potentially important problem with the voting system is that even if a
    security hole was detected in early code, it cannot be fixed until the
    majority votes on it. While the vote is taking place, such hackers can
    exploit a bug in the code.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/dao/dao_types.jpg" alt="Diversity of DAOs">
    <span class="caption text-muted">There are diverse DAO categories and more and more DAOs created in those</span>
</p>
<h2>
    How to invest
</h2>
<p>
    Investing in a DAO is relatively easy, especially if we know have
    experience buying other cryptocurrencies and we already have a wallet
    to store the coins. All we really need to do is buy tokens of a
    particular DAO. As described before, buying tokens would be the
    equivalent of buying shares of Amazon, Apple, or Microsoft. In some
    cases, there are dedicated channels like Discord where some interesting
    information is shared.
</p>
<p>
    Once the financing phase is over, we will be able to make proposals,
    vote on them and even obtain benefits. The number of tokens purchased
    will correlate to the amount of voting power we will get within the
    DAO.
</p>
<p>
    However, before investing, we must be sure about the project to know
    exactly what we are getting into. DAOs are completely transparent and
    their underlying code is always open source, which means that only we
    have the opportunity to review the code to make sure there are no bugs
    in it.
</p>
<p>
    It is undeniable that the very concept of DAOs is extremely exciting as
    it strives to solve everything that is wrong with the way modern
    organizations are managed. A perfectly structured DAO gives each
    investor the opportunity to shape the organization. There is no
    hierarchical structure, which means that each innovative idea can be
    submitted by anyone and considered by the entire organization. With a
    set of pre-written rules that every investor knows before joining the
    organization, as well as the voting system, they leave no room for
    discussion.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, since both submitting a proposal and voting in favor of it
    require the investor to spend a certain amount of money, it pushes him
    to evaluate his decisions and not waste time on ineffective solutions.
    Finally, as all the rules, as well as each of the financial
    transactions, are registered in the Blockchain, available for review by
    anyone, the DAOs are completely transparent. Everyone who participates
    helps decide how to spend the funds and can track how those funds are
    spent.
</p>
<h2>
     Examples
</h2>
<p>
    Depending on the purpose, there are several types of DAOs. Some of them
    are the following ones:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Investment DAOs
    </li>
    <li>
        Collector DAOs
    </li>
    <li>
        Entertainment DAOs
    </li>
    <li>
        Grant DAOs
    </li>
    <li>
        Protocol DAOS
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In this article, we will focus on some names related to different DAO
    categories, with no preferential order.
</p>
<h3>
    Maker DAO
</h3>
<p>
    This is probably one of the most famous DAO out there. We have seen
    that with DeFi, we can reach the democratization of finance and we can
    make many products available to almost everyone around the world
</p>
<p>
    MakerDao, not to be confused with DAO Maker, has world’s first unbiased
    currency, Dai, which is a Maker Dao’s star product. DAI is a stable,
    decentralized currency that does not discriminate. Any individual or
    business can take benefit from the advantages of digital money.
</p>
<p>
    Dai is a stable coin, hence there is no volatility and for that reason,
    it is used in different financing projects. With this coin, you can
    exchange your assets for Dai and use this money in various aspects of
    finance.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding governance, a community of MKR token holders governs the
    Maker Protocol, the smart contracts that power the stable coin Dai.
</p>
<p>
    Over 400 apps and services such as wallets, DeFi platforms, or games
    have integrated Dai as an allowed payment method.

<h3>
    KlimaDAO
</h3>
<p>
    With the importance of climate change and small reactivity from some
    governments and companies, it is time that we do something about it.
    While our actions may not have had much positive impact in the past. we
    can start pushing for a change with KlimaDao
</p>
<p>
    With KlimaDAO, users can make a better more sustainable and greener
    world, by fighting against climate change. Via this mechanism, owners
    of this token can earn rewards with the KLIMA token. KLIMA is a digital
    currency backed by real carbon assets.
</p>
<p>
    They have started a decentralized and open market for carbon. Besides,
    the KLIMA token incentivizes investors, citizens, and organizations to
    participate in and govern this new economy.
</p>
<p>
    By increasing access and demand for carbon offsets, KlimaDAO makes
    pro-climate projects more profitable. At the same time, this process
    forces companies to adapt faster to climate change.

<h3>
    Olympus DAO
</h3>
<p>
    With all the central banks printing money and excessive Quantitative
    Easing, these actions have led to many negative consequences. For
    example, it has caused the devaluation of our currencies and assets in
    most countries.
</p>
<p>
    Olympus is building a community-owned, decentralized, and
    censorship-resistant reserve currency that is deeply liquid,
    asset-backed, and used widely. The name of this currency is OHM.
</p>
<p>
    With the rise of decentralized finance and economy, these concepts will
    also need a decentralized reserve currency. In other words, we need a
    currency that is not pegged to any central bank or fiat system
</p>
<p>
    Via this, Olympus DAO’s goal is to build a stable but independent
    currency that achieves purchasing power, broad acceptance, and high
    utility for all users.

    interested in this DAO whose goal is to buy an NBA franchise.
</p>
<p>
    Krause House is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) ruled
    through a network of enthusiasts, basketball enthusiasts, and purists.
    Together, we can write the consensus regulations as an effective way to
    bring the primary fan-ruled group to the NBA. The collective of
    formidable participants whose purpose is to very own an NBA crew
    describes the underlying mission of DAOs in its purest form:
</p>
<p>
    They will permit our contributors to take part in selections affecting
    the running approaches of a National Basketball Association (NBA) crew
    along with however now not restrained to a standard control, ticketing,
    merchandising, and partnership.
</p>
<p>
    This means that you can be the owner of an NBA team without being Mark
    Cuban or Steve Ballmer. Imagine signing the next free agent or picking
    your favorite prospect in the NBA draft? This will be soon possible.

<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    DAOs and crypto in general have brought different benefits to users.
    Some of them are access, costs, or transparency. We are happy about the
    fact that are more opportunities that focus on our goals and that via
    pooling individuals with the same objectives we can achieve our desired
    goal. At the same time, there is also criticism related to the level of
    experience the members may have. The comment is that as opposed to
    traditional organizations, where a specific number of experience people
    (e.g. board of directors) make the decisions, granting all members of a
    DAO the power to make any change may not be the best generating the
    best results for these autonomous organizations in the long-term.
</p>
<p>
    However, what is certain is that DAOs have created disruption and could
    shake in the long-term the current organization design and how the
    interactions within these.
</p>
<p>
    Although there has been an increase in the number of DAOs, we will see
    many more interesting in the next years. In case you would like to
    investigate further, please note that the code of these DAOs is
    accessible. Therefore, please analyze in deep the content and the data
    in order to detect any problem independent of the topic/goal of the
    chosen one.
