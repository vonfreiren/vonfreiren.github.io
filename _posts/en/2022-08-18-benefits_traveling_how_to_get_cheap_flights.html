<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    <p>
        We are in this time of the season where airports are packed and there is a
        peak of flights when everybody is taking one or more flights to go to the
        planned destination some weeks before. Despite the petrol price, different
        strikes, and other inconveniences, after two years of the COVID pandemic,
        the flight levels are back to 2019 levels and the predictions for the next
        years are quite optimistic.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    This can be explained by the benefits that flying brings and the
    limitations and restrictions. we had in the last 2 years. The freedom that
    was taken from us made us value more the possibility of having now the
    possibility to choose where to go.
</p>
<p>
    Related to this, the first thing we know is that experiences are better
    than possessions. With the millennials, we have been an increasing
    prioritization of these experiences over possessions such as houses or
    cars.
</p>
<p>
    The trip of our dreams is something that we look forward to and our goals
    is how to fly more and how to find good deals when looking for these trips.
    It’s something we include in the wishes for the next year.
</p>
<p>
    Although some useless governments are now with the idea of reducing the
    number of flights or other nonsense regulations, who cares about what they
    say? Although topics such as pollution or energy management are constant
    problems, maybe they should be the first ones to apply these rules and
    avoid their usual useless trips.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, why not benefit from more and affordable trips during the year?
    In order to achieve this, there are some steps that we need to consider.
</p>
<p>
    They are not complex at all, but these are some tricks in order to help you
    with your next trip.
</p>
<h2>
    Planning
</h2>
<p>
    The first phase is the initial planning phase. It does not require a big
    effort but leaving everything unplanned or for the last minute will
    generate unnecessary stress that may ruin our trip. If planned accordingly,
    this will solve different situations and will get you a better price,
    flight and stay. In this case, one suggestion would be to start looking for
    flights some months before the trip. This will ensure that you can analyze
    the different options and mitigate possible risks.
</p>
<p>
    One of the most heard questions is whether is better to spend 1 month in a
    location or have 3 trips in different locations.
</p>
<p>
    Although I prefer in general quality over quality, when it comes to trips
    it is just the opposite. I’m in favor of having more than one. This can be
    achieved by carefully selecting affordable options. Picking 3 flights of
    300 instead of 1 of 1,000 will in my opinion a better choice.
</p>
<p>
    However, this opinion is not based on the price aspect, but also on
    diversification. For example, if you go to one destination for 1 month and
    for whatever reason you don’t like it, the weather is very bad, etc. the
    single trip for the year is ruined. With more options, you diversify more
    and if you travel 3 or 4 times per year, it’s not likely that all of them
    will be a bad choice.
</p>
<h2>
    Adapt to the options
</h2>
<p>
    If you are looking for an exact destination and you suddenly come with a
    super cheap price, It may look the best thing in the world. However, this
    will not be always the case.
</p>

<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/cheap_flights/google_flights.jpg" alt="Essential application">
    <span class="caption text-muted">As we can see in the list of tools, having additional technological support is a must for our search</span>
</p>
<p>
    Despite this may be what we are aiming to achieve, ff you try to hit in the
    middle of the bullseye, you may be a lifetime waiting for it. Flexibility
    is the currency that you may use to get more trips with better prices.
</p>
<p>
    It’s just the opposite. The piece of advice here should be starting to look
    for cheap affordable locations. From that list, you will probably find
    several destinations that may be attractive to you.
</p>
<p>
    You may start by selecting different price ranges within your budget. Out
    of all destinations, you may select the ones with the lowest prices and
    from there you can start selecting which destinations may fit more. Even if
    some of them may not be very attractive, this can be a good opportunity to
    discover the next gem.
</p>
<p>
    It’s often where we see that people go to the same destinations: Paris,
    Madrid, London, etc. These places are normally overcrowded and it’s likely
    that you have already visited. Why not looking something less mainstream?
</p>
<p>
    As said before, being flexible is the attribute that will open more doors
    and get you better deals. First of all: direct flights may be more
    expensive. In this case, there are different options such as different
    flights, companies, dates or even alternative transport methods.
</p>
<p>
    When it comes to short flights, one alternative could be going by
    car/train/bus to a close airport. You may have the option of the parking,
    staying at some friend’s place or even visiting another city before the
    flight.
</p>
<p>
    In some countries, the train will be quite cheap if booked in advance and,
    if you are looking for an international flight, another possibility would
    be to use 2 companies and go first to the connection point. There, you can
    visit the city (1 day trip). Normally, these cities have many inhabitants,
    and you may know someone who you can visit or even he may let you stay for
    the night.
</p>
<p>
    The trick in these cases is to have a good margin between the first and
    second flight. If for some reason, there is no time left to leave the
    airport for a short visit to the city, another advice is to get some
    accessories that will make your trip much easier:
</p>
<p>
    Battery charger, eBook or book, and headphones. Another trick is that
    without or bad connection to use the laptop to work on work or personal
    project. If you don’t have Internet connection, you will not get disturbed
    by constants notifications.
</p>
<p>
    In the last 21 days, prices will skyrocket. You may have seen too many The
    Simpsons episodes (e.g., when they go to Japan), but it is unlikely that
    you will get a last-minute deal. These prices are high because are more
    focused on business travelers who don’t have any other alternative and they
    (the company) will pay the ticket fare.
</p>
<h2>
    Some tools
</h2>
<p>
    When it comes to additional help, there are hundreds of tools on the
    Internet that can be used to keep track the different offers. For example:
    Kayak, Skyscanner, Google Trips or your own tools.
</p>
<p>
    For example, in my case using Python and MongoDB I have created a tool that
    checks flights with multiple destination and dates combinations and will
    store the best option (duration and price) for each combination on each
    day. The cheapest option on each day is stored and the moment the price
    goes down, it sends you an alert. Playing with alerts on the service you
    may use is off the essence.
</p>
<p>
    Since we were discussing the flexibility, I have found that Google Flights
    allows including many origin and destination airports on the same search.
    With this useful feature, you can get the best deals with one single
    search. You can also add notifications. The disadvantage with Google
    Flights is that some flights may not appear.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/cheap_flights/mongodb.jpg" alt="Basic but working">
    <span class="caption text-muted">This is the basic applicaiton that just collects the flight information such as the price, duration, destination and origin. Once there is a decrease in the price, it sends an email to inform about the change.</span>
</p>
<p>
    Another trick is to book on those airline companies that offer free
    cancellation. This way you make sure that the highest price you will pay in
    your search will be the one you already had and everything you get below
    that is your gain.
</p>
<h2>
    Other tricks
</h2>
<p>
    Saving in flights means that your budget for doing other trips,
    restaurants. Instead of going to a 4-start restaurant, you may end up in a
    5-star hotel and go to Michelin-starred restaurants. Therefore, you should
    invest in planning and flexibility because this way you can spend the money
    in more important things.
</p>
<p>
    Although it may sound strange to you with the recent surge in travel
    tickets due to inflation, strikes and gas prices, prices are each year
    lower. This is due to big competition in the airline industry. It’s a
    regulated sector with several years of history and since World War II
    prices have been decreasing – after adjusting the price considering
    inflations –
</p>
<p>
    Then, how do airlines make money? While flying was a premium some years
    ago, luckily it has been accessible to more and more people. The revenue
    sources have changed too. As opposed to some decades ago, we that revenues
    do not come mainly from the ticket, but from other extras such as baggage
    fees, seat fees, other products, bundles, business trips, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Another question you may have seen is on which day to book the flight. How
    does this algorithm work?
</p>
<p>
    There is no specific day or hour where you may find the best price.
    Although you may have heard different opinions based on different sources,
    there is no specific time where you will get the best price.
</p>
<p>
    However, one thing is to consider. Mondays and Fridays are normally the
    most expensive days because these are the days where business trips take
    place. People will get on the plane to a specific destination and come back
    on Friday. For short trips, this is also the best time in order to spend
    the whole weekend abroad.
</p>
<p>
    Excluding these days, the best days are Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday.
    Again, this does not mean that they will be always the cheapest flights.
</p>
<p>
    When it comes to months, August is traditionally the most expensive month
    (some people don’t have any choice for holidays) and Christmas. Therefore,
    selecting the correct dates may also be a relevant factor.

    The rules above are quite general and there is no written rule. It may be
    that one day a flight ticket from Net York to Amsterdam is 600 and the day
    after is 300 EUR. For this reason, it’s important to benefit from
    technology and your favorite tool and get noticed as soon as this change
    occurs.
</p>
<h2>
    Key takeaways
</h2>
<h3>
    Plan and plan
</h3>
<p>
    Don’t leave things for the last minute. Have a good planning will have
    benefits on both the stress and the price you will end paying for the
    tickets or any other service you may need.
</p>
<p>
    Start looking in advance is also key. Depending on the type of flight, you
    should start looking between 2 to 8 months in advance.
</p>
<p>
    Booking at the earliest date does not always mean the cheapest price but
    waiting for the last minute will always mean a high price.
</p>
<h3>
    Flexibility
</h3>
<p>
    If you want to travel as much as possible during the year, be flexible.
    Don’t start looking for one single destination. Open your mind and look for
    affordable places you may not even know they exist. Learn about them. As
    mentioned above, it’s key to plan accordingly. Once you have investigated
    if you would like to go to one of the placed that popped up, see if this is
    the place where you would like to stay. In many cases, because of the low
    expectations, these can be a total surprise and you may want to come the
    year after again.
</p>
<h3>
    Tools
</h3>
<p>
    Use technology with some many tools available, we can really benefit of
    instant notifications when we find a good deal. In some cases, it may be
    difficult to configure some alerts but
</p>
<h3>
    Practice
</h3>
<p>
    What’s I the right price? How should I risk? When should I pull the
    trigger? These questions require practice and knowing the different routes
    or companies. Even if I have no plans to fly, what I normally do is also
    setting up some alerts where I can see the different prices and the price
    evolution. Remember that time is against you, so the moment you find a good
    deal after having performed the different steps, just go for it.
</p>
