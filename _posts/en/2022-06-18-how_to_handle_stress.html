<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    <p>
        While our life is easier compared to some years ago in many aspects, the
        first world has also led to new trends, problems, or even diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unknown or ignored in the past in the past, the importance of our mental
        health is taking the attention it deserves. We need to understand that
        there are few important things that our mind and body. Not taking care of
        it, may lead to several issues in our behavior, thinking or mood.
</div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Stress can be characterized as a response to any occasion which is seen,
        deliberately or unknowingly, as a danger to our safety or happiness. Stress
        which we experience as unmanageable can be detected as injury by our
        sensory system and become part of ourselves, damaging our body
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are some of my tricks to make sure that we fight back and defeat our
        worst fears and the general stress from our life.
    </p>
<p class="big">
<hr class="bigHr">
</p>
    <h3>
        1. HIIT
    </h3>
    <p>
        Low intensity training may be boring and will not cause much an impact once
        done. However, if we switch to high intensity interval training, in just
        20-minute sessions we will not just achieve more than in the low-paced
        session, but it will also help generate more hormones.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of these hormones involved in the process is cortisol. Cortisol is
        known to handle stress
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, if you are changing to go to the next level when it comes to
        your workout, this may also help reduce the stress.
    </p>
    <p>
        As with anything, everything in excess is bad. Therefore, too much workout
        will also not be the best option for de-stressing, because it will also
        have negative impact in our cortisol levels, being these too high.
    </p>
    <h3>
        2. Meditate
    </h3>
    <p>
        Meditation can provide you with a feeling of peace, harmony, and quietness.
        This process can help both your general wellbeing. You may use the
        mediation to relax and focus all the activity on fighting the stress. Not
        just that but being an expert on this technique can help you stay focused
        and keeping your inner peace. This means that, like sports, the benefits
        don’t end once you stop meditating, but in upcoming stressful environments
        and situations too.
    </p>
    <h3>
        3. Cook some pasta
    </h3>
    <p>
        When it comes to stress, it is also known that some people like cooking to
        disconnect from the world. Apart from that
    </p>
    <p>
        Eating complex carbohydrates may be not the best idea if you are trying to
        lose weight and cut additional calories. However, if you are stressed, why
        not having your favorite recipe of Your favorite Rigatoni Bolognese or
        spaghetti amatriciana after a nice workout session? It’s been
        scientifically proved that eating pasta can increase the serotonin levels,
        which amongst many tasks, it helps regulate anxiety, mood, and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, you should not abuse of too many carbs. When it comes to
        food, it must be important to say that ultra-processed food and sugar will
        have a negative impact. Therefore, it is also good to keep our diet as
        healthy as possible. It has a big impact in both our body and mental
        health.
    </p>
    <h3>
        4. Dress <strike>up</strike> down
    </h3>
    <p>
        Nature is not something in the environment, but it’s something that we can
        carry with ourselves. That’s why it’s important to choose the correct
        clothes when starting the day. For example, if you want to reduce
        eagerness, the best way after having your morning shower is selecting
        carefully natural clothes (linen, cotton, etc.) that will create a relaxed
        outfit. If you are stressed, dressing up with tight and elegant clothes may
        not be the best choice. Having a comfier garment on you will help you have
        a more easygoing lifestyle.
    </p>
    <h3>
        5. Explore nature
    </h3>
    <p>
        It’s said that people on villages are much happier than those living in big
        cities with all the traffic, pollution, and noise. It may be easier for
        some and more difficult for other. Nonetheless, one suggestion for those
        living in big cities is to try to escape for some days or do some
        excursions to the beach, lakes, or mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
        Especially these ones may be the best choice because researchers have
        proved that since air in high altitude is charged with negative ions (atoms
        that have lost electrons), these molecules help hikers relax and forget
        about their problems.
    </p>
    <h3>
        6. Sleep, Sleep &amp; Repeat
    </h3>
    <p>
        The function of sleeping has many processes behind that helps repair our
        brain and bodies. We all would like to have more time and we often tend to
        sacrifice our sleeping time in order to get many more things done in the
        day. However, with this are generating debt that we will pay the days
        after.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sleeping does not just make sure that we are more productive the day after,
        but it helps our whole body to recover and handle the stress accordingly
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s a vicious circle. Stress leads to insomnia and insomnia leads to more
        stress.
    </p>
    <h3>
        7. Switch it off
    </h3>
    <p>
        Having multiple devices with thousands of notifications per day is not the
        best way to stay focused and in good mood. Apart from the constant
        distractions, some of these messages and pop ups will create negative
        feelings (war, crisis, hunger, etc.) and increase the level of stress
        inside our bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
        For that reason, it is a good idea to keep the number of apps in our phone
        as reduced as possible and have some focus times defined in our day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another piece of advice is that once the workday or week are over, just
        toggle off the mailbox from your phone and hide the work laptop somewhere
        else. Even if it would seem that the world will collapse if you do so, try
        also to minimize the usage of your mobile phone to just those moments that
        really required.
    </p>
    <h3>
        8. Coffee
    </h3>
    <p>
        This one may be very obvious, but once we get into this habit is not easy
        to stop. We have discussed what the negative consequences of not sleeping
        are. The day after we need some energy, and the most accessible drug is a
        coffee shot. Since it seems to wake us up, we try one after another and
        some minutes later we are active, but our stress levels have also gone
        quite up. Cutting drastically coffee may be suicidal for some people.
        Therefore, a better idea may be to cut it progressively and replace it for
        healthier drinks such as green, matcha, black, and red tea. These infusions
        have great benefits when it comes to sleep quality, anxiety, and management
        of hormones
    </p>
    <h3>
        9. Eat more fruit
    </h3>
    <p>
        Either in solid state or in form of shakes and juices, fruit is very
        important and has a big impact on our bodies. Not just in our bodies or
        diet, fruits contain big amounts of different vitamins – for instance C and
        D-, that help us surpassing the stress threshold level. Therefore, these
        products can be a good booster to our anti-stress protection.
    </p>
    <p>
        If for some reason, you think you will not reach the needed vitamin levels,
        having some supplements will also help us achieve our goals.
    </p>
    <h3>
        10. Breathing Exercises
    </h3>
    <p>
        This one can be a technique that is used just when we are about to blow up or collapse.
        The trick in those tense situations is to handle our breathing in a good,
        consistent way with an efficient technique.
    </p>
    <p>
        You need to be as comfortable as you can and try to evade your mind and
        focus just on controlling your breathing. For example, put attention to the
        effect of inspiring through the nose and expiring through the moth.
        Counting the process will also help if you want to focus just on this
        activity as much as you can.
    </p>
    <h3>
        11. Spend time with animals
    </h3>
    <p>
        As with nature, spending time with animals will let us avoid our current
        work and responsibilities, with a more easygoing approach to life. The make
        us more aware of what the important aspects of life are.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, it has been confirmed that being in contact with animals such
        as dogs or cats activate the oxytocin hormone, which regulates the stress
        and comfort.
    </p>
    <h3>
        12. Read a novel
    </h3>
    <p>
        When there are many topics going through your mind, what I do is just
        trying to disconnect and focusing on only single topic. The easiest way to
        do so is taking the favorite book from the shelf or your book eReader.
        Although it is said that music may be a better way to disconnect it has
        been demonstrated with multiple researchs that reading a science or
        adventure story helps us totally disconnect from our daily tasks immersing
        ourselves in the story. In any case, you can leave the music for your HIIT
        session.
    </p>
    <h3>
        13. Switch on the PS4
    </h3>
    <p>
        In the case a book is not enough for you to evade the reality and manage
        the anxiety, a more active solution would be going to your computer or vide
        console and playing an adventure or any other type of game.
    </p>
    <p>
        As it occurs when reading, videogames help us distract ourselves with the
        preferred games. Videogames are engaging, fun and at the same time they are
        somehow challenging, getting some rewards. At the same time, as eating
        pasta, they increase our serotonin levels, having a positive impact on our
        well-being and mood.
    </p>
    <h3>
        14. Massage session
    </h3>
    <p>
        Massages can be a great complement to an exercise and apart from the
        muscular regeneration benefits, they also have benefits when it comes to
        anti-stress techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
        They help reduce the heart rate, blood pressure and overall improving our
        sleep quality and mental health, giving a boost to our well-being. Having
        just a 15–30-minute session can be a shot of good emotions and feelings.
    </p>
    <h3>
        15. Clean your body
    </h3>
    <p>
        To conclude the list, cleaning your body and face might me a good activity
        to increase our mood and relaxation levels. You may start exfoliating your
        face, continuing with a long bath with bath salts and candles and putting a
        face or ice will probably the best idea after a stressful working day.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the whole process you will leave the bathroom totally rejuvenated –
        and not just for your skin -.
