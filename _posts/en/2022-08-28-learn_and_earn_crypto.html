<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    <p>
        Some centuries ago, different organizations across Europe and Asia were
        accused of conspiracies and polemics. Mostly these accusations were
        provoked by the information that these sects or groups kept for themselves.
        or Myth or reality, what cannot be denied is that in the Middle Ages,
        knowledge was something considered hermetic and exclusive to certain groups
        that wisdom for them and the exclusive members of their circle.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    Fortunately, things have changed in the last decades and in this era of
    information, we have more access to things we could not have imagined a few
    years ago. On the other hand, it may be shocking and paradoxical that in
    this era, we are less cultivated and informed.

<p>
    Knowledge is enough motivation for most of us to learn about new topics,
    but apart what if I tell you that apart from learning interesting topics
    and state of the art technologies you can also get rewarded?
</p>
<p>
    As discussed in previous articles, the best investment you can make is
    learning. It’s undeniable the benefits that the continuous learning brings
    in the long term.
</p>
<p>
    Although, learning by itself is already a rewarding and motivating
    activity, some of use will also appreciate additional bonuses. Keeping us updated is important in the competitive world we all live in.
    Not just for now, but for future years.
    By reward, I don’t mean just the new information or benefits you get, but
    new tokens, coins, or discounts you may get.
</p>
<p>
    This post is not merely about getting free coins, but also new skills that
    you can get and apply in your professional world. Let’s dig deeper to see
    what these options are.
</p>
<br>
<h2>
    Learn to Earn Programs
</h2>
<p>
    The first group of this article is related to those programs where you
    learn the theory, or the basic concepts of a given blockchain or token. In
    the subsections below, you don’t just learn something new, but you also
    have the chance of getting rewarded with crypto currencies.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/learn_earn/coinbase.jpg" alt="Pioneer">
    <span class="caption text-muted">In the Learning Rewards Section you can see different articles, courses and quizzes</span>
</p>
<p>
    These are some of the most famous Learn to Earn programs out there, where
    you learn interesting new topics and you are rewarded in different manners.
</p>
<p>
    Please bear in mind that these courses do not have any requirements such as
    “deposit 10 to earn 20, etc.”. Apart from learning and reading/watching the
    information, the only other requirement is that in some cases you may need
    to verify and pass the KYC checks.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    Coinbase
</h3>
<p>
    Coinbase is sometimes criticized for different reasons such as
    business-related topics (dismissal of employees, business plan) or the
    trading fees. However, since they started in 2018, they have promoted
    different initiatives in the crypto community. One of the most famous ones
    is the Learning Rewards program, where users can earn different tokens. The
    process is quite easy and just watching a short video and answering some
    questions you can get some free tokens.
</p>
<p>
    There is no surprise here and you can exchange as soon as you receive. The
    rewards are not a big amount, but, lately, they tend to occur quite often.
    Regardless of the rewards, videos are nice to watch and very well done. In
    addition to these videos, you may also see different articles.

<h3>
    Binance
</h3>
<p>
    Binance is without any doubt, the largest crypto exchange in the world. In
    my opinion, the initially based Chinese exchange may be quite annoying with
    several daily notifications, but Changpeng Zhao’s organization have also
    several nice initiatives for their customers.
</p>
<p>
    Since 2022, they have followed what Coinbase started and offer some small
    rewards for watching some videos and answering different questions. There
    are several courses, and the rewards are quite small. However, it is nice
    to understand and be aware of new projects, and in addition to learning and
    getting new ideas, being rewarded for so.

<h3>
    Cake DeFi
</h3>
<p>
    Cake DeFi is a quite new player in the Decentralized Finance sector and now
    quite known for many people. However, with their current solutions, it is
    likely that you will get hear from them more and more. They are a company
    based in Singapore specialized in passive income, being the main pillars of
    these platform the following s
</p>
<p>
    1. Liquidity mining: as opposed to centralized exchanges, in a DEX, liquidity
    is needed in order to enable trades between the different pairs. With
    liquidity mining you provide your crypto assets so other can use these to
    trade.
</p>
<p>
    2. Staking: Via the Proof of Stake protocol, you lock your tokens to protect
    the network., and you get rewarded with additional tokens
</p>
<p>
    3. Lending: The last strategy one is income generated from lending your coins
    to other DeFi participants.
</p>
<p>
    With the available courses, you can at the moment earn the following
    tokens.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        DFI (DeFiChain) tokens
    </li>
    <li>
        BTC-DFI Tokens
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Both of them are allocated to Staking and Liquidity mining, but after you
    unfreeze them you can do whatever you want with the coins you got in the
    courses plus the ones you got from the freeze period.
</p>
<p>
    There is also a course coming soon related to Ethereum, where you will also
    learn something new and get rewarded.

<h3>
    Revolut
</h3>
<p>
    Revolut is very good for many aspects such as banking, currency conversion,
    travelling and the super cool features of the app such as virtual cards or
    instant transfers. However, when it comes to their investment features such
    as purchasing stock or crypto, there are still some aspects that should be
    improved.
</p>
<p>
    That’s probably why in order to take off, Revolut has launched a Learn
    &amp; Earn Program related to Polkadot. Compared to other courses, the
    lessons are related to one of the most important blockchains and the
    amounts are also higher.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the videos, you have also the option to see the glossary,
    where some important crypto and blockchain terms are explained.
</p>
<p>
    There is no referral program here and you will get those tokens for you.
    You decide if you want to sell them for fiat or exchange them the moment
    you receive them.

<h2>
    Technical Courses & Sites
</h2>
<p>
    Although the previous courses will reward you with direct tokens and the
    ones below will not, given the lack of technical skills that we will see in
    the future, the courses below may have a more relevant reward in upcoming
    years.
</p>
<p>
    Once we have focused described the most important courses related to
    business and blockchains, we can also get more technical and in this
    matter, there are also very good courses to add new skills.
</p>

<h3>
    Uniswap
</h3>
<p>
    Uniswap, named as the name of the company that created it, is one of the most famous decentralized exchanges. Apart from the
    exchange and being an example of governance, Uniswap explains clearly very
    important topics related to DeFi.
</p>
<p>
    They offer some projects located in GitHub and the open-source interface
    for their protocol is available in GitHub.

    paid from their grant program.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    As with many things in life, the best learning is practicing. Therefore,
    simple, or complex, why don’t start creating your own project once you know
    the basics? We are privileged to live in an era where information is
    accessible for everyone with infinite level of resources.
</p>
<p>
    As you may see from the links, the technical courses may require more time,
    so it would be better to start learning the basic concepts from the first websites.
</p>
<p>
    With new technologies and the expected growth, these technologies will
    eliminate several jobs, but there will a job shortage and companies not
    able to hire new talent because there are too few professionals with the
    required skills. One of them may be blockchain and everything that
    surrounds this industry.
