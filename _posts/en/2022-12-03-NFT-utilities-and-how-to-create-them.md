# Utilities of NFTs

## Introduction

<div class="text-article">
2021 was the year of the NFTs where we saw a boom in the Non-Fungible Token trading transaction volume thanks to the
ERC-721 standard created back in 2018. This trend seems that has diminished recently in the current crypto bear market,
but contrary to what some people thought we have more and more marketplaces and sites that offer you the chance to
discover your next collectible.</div>


Although NFTs are known for art and just some characteristic images, this article will not be focused merely on the
artistic side, but also other utilities that Non-Fungible Tokens can bring to your entertainment and lifestyle.

The term Non-Fungible Token means that this item is unique and cannot be duplicated. If you are the owner of an NFT,
this piece belongs just to you and this ownership is reflected in the blockchain network. Different Blockchain network
such as the mentioned one from Ethereum or others such as Avalanche, or Solana make this possible.

## Origins of NFTs

It all happened in 2021. There is no exact reason for the boom of NFTs during this year, but there some events that most
probably had something to do with the rise of NFTs.

During this period, more and more people jumped into the crypto world. In some cases, they did not have a previous
investment background and this phenomenon opened many doors in the retail industry. Furthermore, some famous people and
investment firms also promoted this change. Besides, Investment banks that had criticized Bitcoin in the past changed
their mind and some of these firms started also offering these alternative assets to their clients.

On one hand, the central banks low-interest or quantitative easing policies caused a huge increase of the different
crypto assets. Another topic that helped with this was the creation of different communities such as Bored Apples or
CryptoPunks

If we put everything into the mix, we saw what we saw with the explosion of NFTs that occurred some years ago and the
adoption of these in the society.

## Utilities

However, although NFTs may be linked to pictures or avatars, there are a lot of areas beyond this topic where NFTs can
play a great role, either now or in the years to come. Although it may seem interesting too, we will not talk about the
several millions that were paid to acquire some NFTs in auction houses such as Christie's or on-chain.

If you have not realized about the potential across sectors that NFTs have, you will probably see that these will impact
for good these sectors in the future.

### Art

With the democratization of art, this means that all artists can promote their creativity and by doing so, they are also
able to reach to more people. With NFTs, you and only you are the owner of these unique pieces. Who know where the next
Picasso or Dali will be? This means that art lovers and the search of the next gem is not limited to just some
privileged collectors with good connections, but to everyone who loves art and beauty.

### Videogames

Non-Fungible Tokens have a lot of possibilities when it comes to the gaming industry. The boom of online video games,
e-sports and open world games have helped achieve this. If we think about the most iconic series, several utilities can
be proposed.

For example, in MOBA games such as League of Legends, having a unique skin and spell effects for you character could not
just improve your gaming experience but also trade with them after you get tired of it.

Although the normal price of skins is considerably low, this means that they are not unique, and you may see all the
time the same ones when playing the game. Knowing the number of fanatic gamers, it would be interesting for some of them
to have a unique skin that would make other players jealous. For companies, it would need to be checked whether this
business model makes sense (high volume and low price or selling just one single skin for several thousands of dollars)

### Music

Instead of collecting limited edition vinyl records or CDs, the next step in our constantly changing world could be
having the original copy or even special edition versions or unreleased remixes of top hits. Instead of having the
physical copy you would have it registered in the blockchain.

For musicians and DJs, this can be a great very interesting mechanism, same as art makers, to promote their job and
access to different users around the world. This also removes intermediaries that take a big piece of the cake.

For example, if you like EDM and you go to festivals often, you may have noticed that recently the songs that the
different DJs play are the ones that are being played everywhere, and they tend to play the latest hits. You may have
seen this in festivals such as Ultra or Tomorrowland. This makes the music sessions not as original as before.

If you attend one of these sets, this can be the only time you can hear a specific unreleased song because they are the
sole owners of this one. Some collectors may be interested on this specific version and request the artist to buy it.

In connection to the commercial side of this feature, since you are the owner of this song, you could set a
subscription/reproduction fee if someone wants to play your song.

    <span class="caption text-muted">Nostalgic collectors may not think the same, but collecting music in new format files add many new possibilities and reduces problems such as storage or conservation of old formats

### Videos

The movies sector didn't change much in the last decade until Covid arrived. Starting 2020, since people could not go
out, there were several days for some long-awaited movies. In other cases, that they allowed was to offer the movies via
some streaming platforms.

However, what could really revolutionize the art of collecting records of the different movies would be the chance of
having original and unique recordings, such as shorts or cut scenes of your favorite movie. If you think about fans of
the most well-known sagas such as Star Wars or the Godfather, these items could have an exponential increase in a few
years from now.

### Tickets

Imagine going to a football game or concert. This is nothing unusual and something that everyone has done. If you for
example go to a world cup final, you may record videos, etc., but one of the things probably you will want to keep it
for this unique experience will be the tickets of the match you attended.

The same could be applied to other events. Imagine going to last tour of your favorite music band before they split or
retire. This is also something quite unique that would like to keep, and it's probably that something will increase their
value with the years should you want to sell it later.

### Creating and minting NFTs

The good thing about the NFTs is that the steps to create them are quite easy. It's not correct that in order to take
part in these topics you are required to have a technical profile. You may have heard the term "Mint". This is basically
registering the NFT on the blockchain, which in this case will show that belong to your wallet. Obviously, you will need
to create something unique, for which you will need to show some creativity and originality. However, once you completed
your first work, the steps can be summarized as follows:

### Creating a Wallet

If you are new to the crypto world, don't be afraid of terms. Creating a wallet is something that not many people do at
the moment, but I can guarantee that as with other technologies, in the future everyone will have their own wallet where
they can keep and guard their assets without the need of a middleman. As just discussed, this is something that anyone can do
regardless of their background and technology skills.

Some of the most popular wallets out there are Metamask, Coinbase Wallet or Phantom.

### Choosing the chain

The choice of the wallet is linked to the blockchain where you operate and the marketplace where you want to show your
item. Some blockchains you may consider are Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Tezos. The chain you use will have an impact
in the site or platform where you want to show your NFTs. As with the wallet, the marketplace you choose in the second
point is also linked to this step.

### Selecting the NFT marketplace

Some of the most famous sites to trade NFTs are OpenSea, Magic Eden or Rarible and they offer different However, as we
discussed in the introduction, you see more and more often new places dedicated to certain niche markets.

If you are new into this world, some benefits of OpenSea is that you don't pay any gas fees when minting and
these fees are just paid if you sell your NFT.

### Tokenizing the NFT

When creating the NFT, it is recommended to provide additional information and not just the basic details. For example,
include some details like the name, the collection, and other technical details.

### Showing and selling the NFT

Once you have linked your wallet to the desired site, you can just show your collection, sell the items, or buy new NFTs
to add to your collection. In this example, I just included the basic steps, but of course the industry is constantly
evolving, and you will see new wallets, marketplaces and chains.
