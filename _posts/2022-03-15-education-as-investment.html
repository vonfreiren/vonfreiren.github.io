<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
        I strongly believe, as some famous people have said, that investing in yourself
        is the best choice you can make in order to learn new skills and
        overcome your weaknesses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nowadays we are seeing a surge of online platforms and definitely users
        have more chances of learning something new and applying these skills. The
        times of having to go to physical classes is hopefully over.
    </p>
    <p>
        Learning doesn’t necessarily mean studying or joining some classes. You can
        certainly learn new skills by listening, reading or observing how other
        people act.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nonetheless, we are leaving these last actions for another post and in this
        article I’m introducing different courses that could be beneficial in your
        future.
    </p>
    <h2 class="section-heading">
        Corporate finance – IESE Business School
    </h2>
    <p>
        I remember this was my first course at Coursera. I had also no clue about
        the finance world, and it opened many doors in future years. It is also the
        only course I have taken more than once since I really liked it how the
        teacher, Javier Estrada, explained the different topics clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this course you will understand how companies are financed to run their
        business and projects, how the interact with different actors of the global
        financial markets, and different formulas, etc. All in all, after course
        you will understand almost every topic you read in the financial news.
    </p>
    <p>
        For some years, there was a huge demand to have Part II of the course and I
        saw it few months ago that there is indeed a second part. It is also part
        of the specialization Think like a CFO, which includes other 2 courses that
        are detailed better in the sections below.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can find access to the single course or the specialization below.

    <h2 class="section-heading">
        Investment Management – University of Geneva
    </h2>
    <p>
        The investment management course is provided by the University of Geneva in
        collaboration with UBS. The specialization is composed of 4 courses,
        focusing on different finance topics. It starts with an explanation of how
        financial markets work, portfolio allocation, psychological topics that may
        impact our decisions
    </p>
    <p>
        You will finalize the courses seeing other topics such as risk management,
        and new trends such as ESG, HFT or Robo-Advisors.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also interesting to see some real cases that occurred in the past,
        such as the Black Monday. It will conclude with a capstone project where
        you must define the portfolio of one of your clients.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested on switching to finance in your career, I would say
        that this is one of the best courses that you could start.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/foundations-management?">
            Investment Management

    </p>
    <h2 class="section-heading">
        Foundations of Management – IESE Business School
    </h2>
    <p>
        I remember taking this course around the time I was promoted to Manager in
        a consulting company . As the title says, the specialization focuses on 4
        pillars of corporate management and it is not entirely focused on finance.
        The 4 components that are taught in this MOC are:
        <ul>
        <li>Accounting</li>
        <li>Finance For Managers</li>
        <li>Marketing</li>
        <li>Organizational Behavior</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        The first two courses are related to financial topics and how to understand
        the figures of companies, which is one of the most important things to make
        sure that they can work. These are also part of the CFO specialization
        mentioned before.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last 2, are related to marketing strategies and management of people
        within the organization. Although they are not 100% related to finance, it
        is quite likely that they will play an important role future career.
    </p>
    <p>
        Analysis of Business Problems. In this last course and it is a capstone
        project. There you will apply all the skills that you learnt with a real
        case from some years ago and the GasGas enduro and motocross brand.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can find the 5 courses described above in the following link.

    <h2 class="section-heading">
        Financial Markets – Yale University
    </h2>
    <p>
        The last course in this list is probably the most famous one. If not, the
        teacher is probably you may have heard of because he is nothing less than
        the Nobel prize winner Robert Schiller.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whereas the previous ones were specializations, this one is just a single
        course. However, it is longer than a usual course and it is divided into 7
        weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of the course is to go through almost every possible topic to
        understand the whole finance picture. Every week, there is a different
        topic and the ones below are the most important ones that are explained by
        Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
        Corporate finance, insurance, different securities, bubbles, recessions,
        mortgage crisis (e.g., Case–Shiller index, derivatives, investment banking,
        brokers or new innovations in the future are some of the topics that you
        will observe in the series of lessons.

        Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
        Nowadays, unfortunately for most courses you have to pay. However, if not
        mistaken, the one from Robert Shiller is still free. In any case, any of
        the 4 courses or specializations is totally worth it and you also have the
        choice of trying those for 7 days for free.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some topics to investigate in these links and I do not want to
        overwhelm you with too many courses at once. In a few weeks, I will
        introduce other courses that may help you in your professional future, but
        not necessarily linked to finance (or yes). In these cases, all of them are
        from Coursera, but in the future articles I will try to present other
        platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the meantime, happy learning!
