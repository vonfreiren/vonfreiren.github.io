<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    In previous posts, we have explained different alternatives for our
    investments, and related to this one, we have also explained some ones
    focused on crypto or DeFi. The Algorand Foundation is another way to
    diversify your portfolio at the same time you take part in the decisions of
    the Algorand ecosystem. Connected to this, the Algorand Governance second
    period ended some days ago (31 March) and the third period just started
    some days ago
</div>
<p>
    But, what’s Algorand, and what is this Governance? For several people, these
    terms may be completely unknown.
</p>
<p>
    The history of Algorand begins in the year 2017, when the company was
    created by Silvio Micali, a well-known MIT professor, Turing award winner,
    and specialist in cryptography. Micali, who has been part of the crypto
    community since 1980, has significant work in asymmetric cryptography to
    his credit, and is a co-creator with Shafirira Goldwasser of zero-knowledge
    proofs (ZKP).
</p>
<p>
    Micali, who has always been a researcher, knows about blockchain technology
    and Bitcoin in 2015, and is interested in it. At that point, Micali started
    working on his personal cryptocurrency project, he decided to improve the
    specifications of Bitcoin and Ethereum. This led him to associate with
    Nickolai Zeldavich, a colleague from MIT and who served as Head of
    Distributed Systems at this institution, and who participated in the
    Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).
</p>
<p>
    It is how Algorand was created. Algorand's main objective is to become a
    platform dedicated to offering high-speed decentralized applications
    (DApps) and DeFi that are available to everyone. To achieve this, Algorand
    is a permissionless blockchain. In this way, anyone can be part of it,
    within a transparent system in which everyone can achieve success through
    decentralized projects and applications.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, to deal with the Blockchain Trilemma, Algorand is based
    on a powerful and fast consensus protocol that can be used by any user with
    minimal computational power, who owns $ALGO and is online. All of these
    elements give you the right to be chosen to participate in Algorand's block
    consensus, which is a derivative of the Proof of Stake system.
</p>
<p>
    But along with this, Algorand focuses its development on creating tools
    that facilitate the deployment of decentralized applications and all the
    infrastructure necessary for their operation.

<h2>
    How does Algorand work?
</h2>
<p>
    As we discussed a moment ago, Algorand is a permissionless blockchain and
    network. This first point is vital to eliminate any type of barrier in the
    use and evolution of the protocol. The main idea behind this principle is
    to guarantee a high level of decentralization, scalability and security.
</p>
<p>
    Second, Algorand's operation is based on a consensus protocol derived from
    Proof of Stake (called Pure Proof of Stake - PPoS). This system is created
    in order to guarantee the full participation of those who are part of the
    network, providing protection and speed. The use of PPoS is framed in
    achieving block production speed measured in a few seconds, which would
    allow a high scalability of the network, thus serving thousands of users
    concurrently, with truly short waiting times and, above all, with very low
    commission costs.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, the Algorand development team has devised new consensus
    algorithms, Byzantine fault-tolerant systems, and an entirely new hashing
    and digital signature system, with a focus on enabling the greatest
    possible scalability.
</p>
<h3>
    Pure Proof of Stake
</h3>
<p>
    The main pillar of Algorand's scalability and speed is its Pure Proof of
    Stake or Proof of Pure Participation (PPoS) protocol. This protocol is a
    derivative of the well-known Proof of Stake (PoS) of other cryptocurrencies
    such as the upcoming Ethereum Merge. The idea of this protocol in Algorand
    is to allow a sufficiently secure resistance to Byzantine faults, while
    providing great speed in the generation and validation of blocks within the
    network. At the same time, PoS is capable of supporting a large number of
    concurrent users and scales well as the network increases in number of
    validators.

<h2>
    Algorand Governance
</h2>
<p>
    Before introducing the Governance period, we have described how Algorand
    works and the different benefits. Furthermore, the purpose of the
    organization is that everyone has a voice in the future plans of the
    network. The Algorand Governance first period started on 1 October 2021 and
    each of these periods last 3 months.
</p>
<p>
    This is done with a term called “Governor.” Governors are responsible for
    the most important economic and political decisions. This is be done
    through regular public votes that the Algorand Foundation will responsibly
    execute for the benefit of the broader ecosystem, based on the decisions of
    these Governors.
</p>
<p>
    It must be noted that Algorand holders are not automatically enrolled in
    the community governance. Algos holders need to go to the governance web
    portal and specify how many Algo tokens they are going to commit in each
    governance period. To participate, governors must sign a transaction
    representing the amount of tokens invested. The governance web portal can
    be used to generate a transaction in the correct format
</p>
<p>
    For keeping your ALGO, you can use your Ledger, Pera Algo, AlgoSigner or My
    Algo wallet. It must be noted that in order to be eligible for the rewards
    paid at the end of the quarter, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The number of ALGO committed for the period cannot decrease
    </li>
    <li>
        You must vote in the voting session for the respective period
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>
    Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
    Via this mechanism, the main objectives of the Governance periods are the
    following:
</p>
<p>
    On one hand, in this period the owners of ALGO who have committed can
    decide on the future steps of the Algorand network and any improvements
    that can be done via voting.
</p>
<p>
    On another hand, by committing the ALGO tokens, the owners are rewarded.
    There are generally 70.5 Billion algos for rewards. These need to be
    distributed between all the committed ALGO. On average, in the recent
    periods the return rate is around 10% per year, which is around 2.5% per
    quarter.
</p>
<p>
    The more total ALGOs are committed, the lower the APY will be. However, the
    main goal of this governance periods is also to make of the Algorand
    ecosystem the future of finance.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, we can also see recent new projects such as AlgoFi that will
    also play a key role in the growth and adoption of Algorand.
