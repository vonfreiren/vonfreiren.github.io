## New methods of playing with crypto

Wrapped crypto refers to a type of cryptocurrency that has been "wrapped" or tokenized to operate on a different blockchain network. For example, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that operates on its own blockchain network, but it's obvious that it cannot operate in other networks.

However, it can be "wrapped" or tokenized to operate on other blockchain networks such as Ethereum. Talking about Ethereum, and after one of their most memorable months, most wrapped crypto assets occur in the Ethereum network. However, there are other networks such as BNB or Solana, that are also very important in the wrapping process.

In the case of wrapped Bitcoin, the actual Bitcoin is held in custody by a custodian, while a representation of the Bitcoin is issued on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token called wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). This allows users to access the liquidity and features of the Ethereum blockchain while still holding and owning Bitcoin.

## How it works

The process of wrapping crypto involves depositing the original cryptocurrency with a custodian who then mints an equivalent amount of wrapped tokens on the target blockchain. The wrapped tokens are pegged to the original cryptocurrency in a 1:1 ratio, meaning that each wrapped token represents the same value as the original cryptocurrency.

Wrapped crypto has gained popularity as it allows for cross-chain interoperability and enables users to access the benefits of different blockchain networks without having to convert their cryptocurrencies into other tokens or currencies.

Wrapped crypto involves the creation of an asset-backed token on a different blockchain network. This process involves depositing the original cryptocurrency with a custodian who holds it in custody and then issuing an equivalent amount of wrapped tokens on the target blockchain. The wrapped tokens are typically issued as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain or as BEP-20 tokens on the Binance Smart Chain.

To ensure that the wrapped tokens maintain a 1:1 peg with the original cryptocurrency, the custodian must maintain an equivalent amount of the original cryptocurrency in reserve. This reserve is audited by third-party auditors to ensure that the peg is maintained.

Wrapped crypto is used to enable cross-chain interoperability, which allows users to access the benefits of different blockchain networks. For example, a user may hold Bitcoin and want to participate in a decentralized finance (DeFi) application that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. By wrapping their Bitcoin and converting it to wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), the user can then use their WBTC to participate in the Ethereum-based DeFi application without having to sell their Bitcoin.

One advantage of wrapped crypto is that it allows for greater liquidity and accessibility for assets. Wrapped crypto can be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and used as collateral for borrowing and lending on DeFi platforms. This can increase the liquidity and usability of assets, which can in turn lead to greater adoption and value for the underlying asset. With the recent problems in some CEXs, DEX can allow the problem of centralization. Some of these projects are:

1. Uniswap: Uniswap is a decentralized exchange that uses the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to trade ERC-20 tokens, including wrapped versions of Bitcoin (wBTC), Ether (wETH), and other cryptocurrencies.
2. Curve Finance: Curve Finance is a decentralized exchange that specializes in stablecoin trading. It supports trading pairs between various stablecoins, including wrapped versions of Bitcoin (wBTC) and Ethereum (wETH).
3. PancakeSwap: PancakeSwap is a decentralized exchange that runs on the Binance Smart Chain. It supports trading pairs between various BEP-20 tokens, including wrapped versions of Bitcoin (wBTC) and Binance Coin (wBNB).
4. SushiSwap: SushiSwap is a decentralized exchange that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to trade various ERC-20 tokens, including wrapped versions of Bitcoin (wBTC) and Ethereum (wETH).
5. 1inch: 1inch is a decentralized exchange aggregator that searches multiple DEXs to find the best prices for traders. It supports trading pairs between various ERC-20 tokens, including wrapped versions of Bitcoin (wBTC) and Ethereum (wETH).

## Investing in these projects or assets

As with any investment, investing in wrapped crypto involves risk and should be approached with caution. However, there are some potential benefits and considerations to keep in mind when investing in wrapped crypto.

One potential benefit of investing in wrapped crypto is the potential for higher returns. Wrapped crypto can be used for various DeFi activities such as lending, borrowing, trading, staking, and yield farming. These activities can generate returns that may be higher than traditional investments. However, it's important to note that these activities also come with additional risk, such as smart contract risk, liquidity risk, and volatility risk.

Another potential benefit is the increased liquidity and accessibility of assets that wrapped crypto can provide. By wrapping assets, users can participate in DeFi applications that operate on different blockchain networks, as well as access additional liquidity and borrowing power. This can lead to more efficient capital allocation and higher returns.

However, there are also potential risks associated with investing in wrapped crypto. One key risk is the possibility of a breakdown in the peg between the wrapped token and the underlying asset. While the custodian holding the underlying asset is supposed to maintain a 1:1 peg, there is always the possibility of a black swan event or other unforeseen circumstances that could lead to a breakdown in the peg.

Additionally, wrapped crypto is subject to the same risks as any cryptocurrency investment, including market volatility, hacking, and regulatory risk. It's important for investors to conduct thorough research and due diligence before investing in wrapped crypto, and to consider their risk tolerance and investment goals.

In summary, investing in wrapped crypto can potentially offer higher returns and increased liquidity and accessibility of assets, but it also comes with additional risk. Investors should approach wrapped crypto as they would any investment and carefully consider the potential risks and rewards before investing.

## Wrap-up

To wrap-up this topic, Wrapped crypto plays an important role in decentralized finance (DeFi) by enabling cross-chain interoperability and increasing the liquidity of assets. Here are some specific utilities of wrapped crypto in DeFi:

1. Access to different blockchain networks: Wrapped crypto allows users to access the benefits of different blockchain networks without having to convert their cryptocurrencies into other tokens or currencies. This can be especially useful for users who want to participate in DeFi applications that operate on a different blockchain network than the one they hold their assets on.
2. Liquidity provision: Wrapped crypto can be used as collateral for borrowing and lending on DeFi platforms. By wrapping their assets, users can access additional liquidity and borrowing power. This can lead to more efficient capital allocation and higher returns for users.
3. Trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs): Wrapped crypto can be traded on DEXs, which are decentralized platforms that allow users to trade assets without the need for a central authority. This can increase the liquidity and accessibility of assets, making it easier for users to buy and sell their assets.
4. Staking and yield farming: Wrapped crypto can be used for staking and yield farming, which are processes that involve users locking up their assets to earn rewards. This can increase the returns that users earn on their assets and incentivize them to hold their assets for longer periods of time.

Overall, wrapped crypto has become an important tool for increasing the liquidity and accessibility of assets in the DeFi space. By enabling cross-chain interoperability and increasing the number of use cases for assets, wrapped crypto is helping to drive the growth and adoption of decentralized finance.
