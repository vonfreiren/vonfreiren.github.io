<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    When it comes to accessories, I’m of the opinion that men should keep it
    simple. When I was young, I was taught that jewels are for women. On the
    other hand, men should keep it simple. There are different reasons for
    that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Too many accessories will steal attention to your look.
    </li>
    <li>
        Less is more when it comes to men’s fashion. Keep it simple.
    </li>
    <li>
        Unless you are a rapper, probably putting too many accessories will not
        look nice in your daily activities.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    From what you have read, you may already guess that I am not a fan rings,
    earrings or necklaces on men’s looks. However, a watch is something that
    every man should try to wear.
</p>
<p>
    Affordable or exclusive, some watches are undeniable icons and pieces of
    art. In next posts, I will talk about more affordable watches and modern
    classics. However, in this one we focus on models with some history and
    that unfortunately the price may also be exorbitant in some cases. This
    means that they are not for all pockets and even if so, you may prefer to
    spend that money in something else or investing as explained in this
    article.
</p>
<p>
    Here it is a small description of each watch, but you will not see any
    price listed. Please note that for some of them, there is a waiting list
    which could be excessive.
</p>
<h2>
    Rolex submariner
</h2>
<p>
    Introduced in the 1950s, the Submariner Is probably the most famous watch
    in the luxury models. Although it had seen several improvements in terms of
    movements and water resistance, it has kept is essence. Due to its
    versatility and the good marketing, many brands used this design to create
    similar divers.
</p>
<p>
    One of the most know famous campaigns was in the James Bond movies: Dr No
    and From Russia with Love. It remains a classic nowadays and there are
    different versions, material, and colors of it.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from inspiring models from other brands, Rolex has also created new
    models out of the Submariner. A clear example of this is the <strong>Sea-Dweller</strong> introduced in the late 1960s.
</p>
<p>
    For the stated reasons, it is probably one of the most recognizable watches
    in the planet. Since it’s a classic, it may take some time until you can
    buy it from your authorized dealer. On the other hand, we have already said
    that many brands have used this model as inspiration. For this reason,
    there are some alternatives in case you are looking for something more
    affordable

</p>
<h2>
    Audemars Piguet Royal Oak
</h2>
<p>
    The watch house from Le Brassus owes too much to the Royal Oak model.
    Mainly, because without this model, the company would probably not exist
    today. In the 1970’s the Swiss company realized that they would go bankrupt
    if they did not introduce a disrupting model. It was in full era of the
    quartz crisis, triggered by Japanese makers when Audemars Piguet realized
    that they had to disrupt the market.
</p>
<p>
    At that time, the watch company hired Gerald Genta to create something
    unique and completely different to previous watches the house had created.
    This was the creation of a steel sports watch, integrated into a bracelet
    and completely in stainless steel.
</p>
<p>
    Although Audemars Piguet had already a reputation back then, and focused on
    classic dress watches, the Royal Oak is the insignia from this house.
    Today, there are multiple versions of this watch, such as limited editions.
    Furthermore, other companies have taken inspirate from this model.
    Initially just in stainless steel, you may find different variations of
    this model in precious metals, alligator, or rubber strap.
</p>
<p>
    The Royal Oak has appreciated in the last years and the waiting list
    average is 8 years. For that reason, these are some alternatives in
    different price ranges.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        G Shock GA-2100 (Casioak)
    </li>
    <li>
        Tissot PRX Powermatic 80
    </li>
</ul>

</p>
<h2>
    Zenith el Primero
</h2>
<p>
    Although it is not considered in the top tier list of watches, it’s one of
    the most famous watch companies and Zenith has indeed a lot of horological
    history.
</p>
<p>
    However, as it occurs with many topics, the model we are discussing today
    was a total failure on the early stages and there are different reasons for
    this unsatisfactory project.
</p>
<p>
    Zenith started developing some years before the release the first automatic
    chronograph. They released it finally in 1969, with a total project
    duration of 7 years. Just before the release, on the same year, other two
    companies release a Chronograph, being Seiko and Chronographic in that
    order. For that reason. It is not correct to call it “El Primero” (the
    first one). Nonetheless, out of these 3 chronographs, El Primero is the
    most sophisticated and complex one. That’s why it included in the history
    books, and you can find today different versions and reinterpretations of
    it, such as the Skeleton version.
</p>
<p>
    It’s not as sporty as the other models, but you can put it with almost
    anything. In case you would like to buy it, it is less exclusive than the
    other ones listed in this post. You can even buy it from Mr Porter, shop
    that was included in this post. If you want to look for alternative
    chronographs, some of models that are similar to El Primero are.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Rolex Daytona - this is pricier than the Zenith Model and we will talk
        soon about it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Orient panda
    </li>
</ul>
<p>

    <span class="caption text-muted">Multiple reworks and version of the El Primero exist today</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Patek Philippe Nautilus
</h2>
<p>
    Having seen the success of the Royal Oak, another member of the Holy
    Trinity (the other member being Vacheron Constantin) did not want to be
    second to none and they asked the creator of the AP model, Gerald Genta, to
    design a steel and sports watch. If you know about the company from Geneva,
    you will know that they have and were focused on more classic models such
    as the dress watch Calatrava.
</p>
<p>
    Genta was inspired in a ship’s porthole to create the Nautilus, name also
    linked to Captain Nemo’s submarine in the Jules Vern Twenty Thousand
    Leagues Under the Sea novel. When it was created in the mid 70s, the watch
    looked huge and for that reason the success was not immediate. However, the
    undeniable elegant, sporty, and modern design grew slowly on watch lovers
    and has finally become a legend.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, today’s price is even higher than the one of Royal Oak (not
    going into details about the price) if you can afford it. As it occurred
    with the Royal Oak, during these years, there have been different versions
    of the watch in terms of size, caliber, and different limited editions.
    Another top model from this house is the Aquanaut model, which has
</p>
<p>
    The Nautilus is by far the most exclusive watch in this list, but again, we
    are not talking about the price. Furthermore, the waiting list may be
    comparable to the one of the Royal Oak.
</p>
<p>
    Although the design of the Nautilus is unique, here are some alternatives,
    although these ones are not precisely cheap.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Girrard Perregaux Laureato
    </li>
    <li>
        Bulgari Octo Finissimo
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    More classics to come
</h2>
<p>
    We have been talking about classic sport watches that you could wear in
    almost every occasion. You may have noticed that there are no dress watches
    in this list. Although I really like them, like happened with the video
    killing the radio star, sport watches seem to have killed the dress
    watches.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/watches/zen.jpg" alt="Most famous Patek">
    <span class="caption text-muted">The Nautilus is the most famous model of the house and available in different materials and colors</span>
</p>
<p>
    Maybe not killing, but the presence of classic dress watches has been
    reduced considerably in the last years. Who know if they will be on the top
    in a few years from now? However, for the moment, we have described 4 more
    sport watches that can also fit with any look. If you wear one of these or
    their alternative modes, there is no need to at all to add any jewel or
    extravagant accessories to your look
