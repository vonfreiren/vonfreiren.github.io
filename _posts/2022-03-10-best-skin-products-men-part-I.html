<h1>
    Introduction
</h1>
<p>
    There are different daily routines that every person should do when waking
    up . Although it is normal taking a shower is the first thing we do when we
    get up, it is also common knowledge that we don’t pay attention to other
    aspects of our body such as the face. The same applies in the evening when
    we should clean our face. In this article, I’m explaining the different
    steps and a recommended product in order to improve our skin health and
    look younger.
</p>
<p>
    I’m also recommending some products that may help you with this. Please
    note that depending on your skin type, it may be better to choose a
    different product. For thaese cases, I will also recommend other products
    in the upcoming articles related to this post.
</p>
<p>
    It should be clear that I’m just mentioning some steps and for example the
    topics and applications of essence, Retin A or sunscreen are not included
    in this post.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of each section, I will include a link where you can get these
    products with the guaranteed lowest price. However, please feel free to try
    other products or get them somewhere else.
</p>
<h1 class="section-heading">
    Cleansing Gel
</h1>
<p>
    We start with a refreshing cleanser in order to remove all the accumulated
    dirtiness, excess of oil and impurities. This product will also revitalize
    our skin and make it calm, soft and relaxed.
</p>
<p>
    After applying it, you can rinse it and you are ready to go to the next
    step.

    Toner
</h1>
<p>
    The purpose of the toner is to hydrate the skin and to remove the dead
    cells. It also acts as the base for the next products that are applied into
    our face. The toner should refresh your skin and don’t create any
    irritation or issue on it.

    Serum
</h1>
<p>
    Serums contain countless number of active components and there are so many
    for each face and skin types that we could write several articles to
    discuss about them. They contain high amount of ntioxidants or peptides
    that penetrate your skin (after having applied the toner)
</p>
<p>
    In this post, I’m just introducing one with hyaluronic acid, but in further
    posts you will see me recommending a different one.
</p>
<p>
    There is no shortage of them, so I will be discussing other brands soon.

    Moisturizer
</h1>
<p>
    Once we have completed the steps above, we include the final touch with the
    moisturizer. The moisturizer’s goal is to help fight against usual suspects
    such as dryness or acne. The final objective is that after having applied
    all these steps your skin looks healthy, happy and great.
</p>
<p>
    As in the other cases, every person has a different skin type. Therefore,
    please check the guidelines and consider the different recommendations.

    Exfoliation
</h1>
<p>
    I have left the exfoliation for the last part, although it should be
    applied just after the cleanser. The reason is that you should not
    exfoliate your skin every day-
</p>
<p>
    There are many exfoliating types such as physical or chemical. In this case
    we are focusing on the physical face scrubs. Via the exfoliation we remove
    dead cells and we clean our skin. However, the process is more aggressive
    than the steps we described above. For that reason, it should not be used
    more than 3-4 times a week and depending on your skin type it may be even
    not recommended doing that more than twice a week.

    Conclusion
</h1>
<p>
    Following these methods will make that you skin younger and replenished,
    removing some years.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, after following the different steps, you will feel refreshed
    and ready for a new day.
</p>
<p>
    The products are selected on the utmost care, but please do your own
    research. Every person and every skin are different.
</p>
<p>
    As discussed, the products may be available in different places. However, I
    have been always found cheaper at iHerb. The purpose of the article is not
    sharing any referral code, but in case this helps. You may find some
    discounts using the code below:

    additional steps such as chemical exfoliation or the sunscreen to apply-
