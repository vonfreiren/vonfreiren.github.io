<p>In this article we are changing completely the topic and we are introducing 4 online shops where modern men can go for shopping and find the next essential item for their daily activities.</p>
<p>The shops listed here have been included since they are international, and they should be accessible to all or most visitors around the world.&nbsp; They have been on business for several years and apart from the quality, you should always expect a top-notch customer service.</p>
<p>The list has been prepared with the utmost care based on my experience after so many years of shopping in these stores.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading"><a href="https://www.mrporter.com/">JMr Porter</a></h2>
<p>We start the list with a company that was created from to the Net a Porter group, focused on the men apparel. Some years ago, the Net-a-Porter group merged with Yoox and that&rsquo;s why you will see in this page some articles that were available at Mr Porter in previous seasons.</p>
<p>Mr Porter is an online retailer for men fashion. Since the need to put emphasis on the digital world, the application and the website are top quality. They have multiple brands of the most recognizable brands in the world and every year they add new brands (whether they are newcomers to the industry or old players).</p>
<p>Since a few years, they have their own brand: Mr Porter which offers a good quality for the price. Needless to say, that the designs and quality are of the same standards of the other brands listed in this site.</p>
