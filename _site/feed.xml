    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    In previous posts we introduced some investment funds or ETFs focusing on
    specific countries or indexes such as the S&amp;P500 or the Nasdaq. We also
    went further and analyzed some interesting regions with a considerable
    expected growth for the following years.
</p>
<p>
    I have also said that I prefer to focus on these broad investment vehicles
    in order to get the best possible returns with the lowest possible risk,
    due to the diversification that these products offer.
</p>
<p>
    However, this approach may be boring, and we can always allocate some of
    our savings to have some fun, either in the way of cherry picking some
    stocks or in this case with some niche sectors. The idea on selecting these
    specific areas for the ETF, is because we think that there will be a huge
    growth in these sectors in the upcoming years (or in the short-term).
    Depending on our strategy, they help us combine our defensive and
    aggressive options in our portfolio.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the price of a security is composed of the current
    earnings and the estimated growth. This also means that for sectors with a
    high growth, the current price already reflects it.
</p>
<p>
    In any case, these are some of the industries that will create a
    considerable impact in the years to come, and for that reason it may be
    worth to have some of our portfolio destined to any of these sectors.
</p>
<h2>
    Videogames
</h2>
<p>
    When I was young, the video games sector was already important, but it was
    below the movies or the music industry. Today, this industry’s revenue is
    bigger than the one of these two industries combined. The growth has been
    incredible in the last 15 years, but it will for sure not stop there.
</p>
<p>
    While some years ago, most games could not be played online, this activity
    has also changed in the last years, opening new possibilities. For example,
    we have also seen this with the different organizations supporting and
    investing in eSports. New ways of entertainment have been included, giving
    more importance to social or mobile games.
</p>
<p>
    The latest trends such as NFT or the metaverse have also an important role
    on some of these games and the different unique items that the players may
    get. In some cases, the trends could change completely the way we game.
    Therefore, if the growth in the last decade was already impressive, these
    two blockchain phenomenon will help to push the videogames even further.

    <h2>
        Artificial Intelligence
    </h2>
    <p>
        The advance of Artificial Intelligence is unstoppable, as organizations
        are adopting different branches of this technology to boost their
        digital transformation, giving great strength to a market that
        encompasses AI software, hardware, and services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, the application fields of AI range from finance to robot
        control, from image recognition to vehicle driving and much more. We
        can see that big players like Google, Apple, Intel, Amazon, IBM are
        investing massively in the development of this sector. Not long ago,
        Google bough the company DeepMind for $400 million.
    </p>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that seeks
        to bring technology to mimic human behavior. Theorizing of a computer
        mind that mimics the functioning of the human goes back more than half
        a century, in 1956, when the term Artificial Intelligence was
        introduced as part of the Dartmouth Summer Research project.
    </p>
    <p>
        The shift from theory to practice came hand in hand with the rise of
        computer skills. The technological acceleration of recent years has
        allowed the development of increasingly sophisticated and powerful
        algorithms. Today, the application fields of AI range from finance to
        robot control, from image recognition to vehicle driving and much more.
        Big conglomerates like Google, Apple, Intel, Amazon, IBM are investing
        massively in the development of this sector.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to some sources, sales in the next eight years may grow by up
        to 35,570 million dollars, or what is the same, an increase capacity of
        more than 600%. In addition to this astonishing information, investment
        in AI is increasing at a rate of 37% per year and by 2022 it will
        exceed 77 billion dollars, three times more than the current 24
        billion.

    <h2>
        eCommerce
    </h2>
    <p>
        Although eCommerce had been growing steadily for years, COVID-19 was
        the trigger that changed in many cases how we buy different products
        and articles, and in general the shopping experience. Due to the loosen
        restrictions in most countries, the growth has been normalized in 2021,
        but predictions say that eCommerce will be growing every year. Indeed,
        the pandemic helped some people discover that buying could be much
        easier and without any issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some factors helping the growth will be related to mobile phones and
        faster technologies such as 5G. More services such as augmented
        reality, virtual reality, image recognition or artificial intelligence
        will be possible to offer a broader range of possibilities to the
        customer. Besides, almost every company today has an online application
        and from there the user can buy directly almost anything.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, the rise of more payment options such as of
        cryptocurrencies will also be an added benefit to customers wanting to
        buy online.
    </p>
    <p>
        While more senior people were initially reluctant to online shopping,
        younger generations such as the millennials are the early adaptors of
        this trend. This means that this way of buying will be already
        inculcated for the new generations to come and will be seen as
        something completely normal in the everyday life of every customer in a
        few years from now.

    <h2>
        Cannabis
    </h2>
    <p>
        This is a controversial topic in some cases, but the truth is that more
        and more countries are allowing the usage of marijuana for therapeutic
        treatments. I have said that it is a polemic aspect because Cannabis
        has been seen as a criminal or something that should be avoided until
        recently. Although, we need more education on this topic, mainly for
        younger generations. it has been proved that the Marijuana derivative
        medicaments or therapies have multiples benefits in diseases.
        Furthermore, the price of this medication is generally lower compared
        to other alternatives, and it also has less side effects.
    </p>
    <p>
        The US and Canada have been two of the latest countries that have
        approved the usage of Marijuana, and as many things occur, some other
        regions such as Europe or Asia may also follow soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is expected to grow between 2022 and 2030 with an annualized rate of
        25%. Apart from the medical advances, the decriminalization has also an
        important role in this rise.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two factors that will be key for the expansion of the
        Cannabis sector:
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of regulation, it is predicted that more and more countries
        will allow medical treatment with Marijuana or derivatives from this
        drug.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another key aspect is the global population aging. We live more years,
        and because of this, we also suffer from more diseases. In some cases,
        Marijuana can play an important role to mitigate of our life
        expectancy. All in all, Cannabis has the potential to help humankind,
        being part of the different breakthroughs in terms of health.

    <h2>
        Water
    </h2>
    <p>
        Because all these investments don’t have to be necessarily related to
        technological improvements, we refer in this section to one of the
        oldest things in history. We are made for the most part out of water
        and we need water to survive. While people think on electricity or gas
        when investing in different companies, we could survive without these
        two, but water is essential for our survival. Other utilities such as
        oil and gold are also
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately. due to climatic change and other linked problems, water
        is becoming scarcer. Besides, accessing to water in some countries is
        still a nightmare. Out of the total water on earth, 97% is saltwater.,
        and out of the remaining 3%, another percentage is frozen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since we all need water and there is less for all of us, with the
        expected growth of the global population, the more demand and less
        supply means that the value of water will increase.

    <h2>
        Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
        We have described 5 sector that are expected to grow in the years to
        come at cruise speed. Investing in companies that are focused on these
        sectors can add additional diversification to our portfolio, add
        defensive or aggressive variants to it while we have some fun with our
        choice.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are other sectors that were not included in this post, but that
        will grow very much in the next decade. Some of them are the following
        ones: Blockchain, semiconductors or metaverse
    </p>
    <p>
        As mentioned in the introduction, even if they are expected to grow,
        the current price may already reflect the expected expansion and
        development of these industries.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another factor to be noted is liquidity. For example, if you want to
        buy or sell, there may be less options, not just in the form of funds
        or ETFs, but in the number of orders.
    </p>
    <p>
        All in all, there are some advantages and disadvantages when selecting
        niche funds. Therefore, I would not recommend including 100% of your
        portfolio into niche sectors. On the other hand, allocating just some
        of the money into these funds could be a wise and fun option for the
        future.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested on how to access to buy them, an example of
        different funds and ETFs has been included. You can see a list of
        brokers in one of my past articles:

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    In previous posts, we have explained different alternatives for our
    investments, and related to this one, we have also explained some ones
    focused on crypto or DeFi. The Algorand Foundation is another way to
    diversify your portfolio at the same time you take part in the decisions of
    the Algorand ecosystem. Connected to this, the Algorand Governance second
    period ended some days ago (31 March) and the third period just started
    some days ago
</p>
<p>
    But, what’s Algorand, and what is this Governance? For several people, these
    terms may be completely unknown.
</p>
<p>
    The history of Algorand begins in the year 2017, when the company was
    created by Silvio Micali, a well-known MIT professor, Turing award winner,
    and specialist in cryptography. Micali, who has been part of the crypto
    community since 1980, has significant work in asymmetric cryptography to
    his credit, and is a co-creator with Shafirira Goldwasser of zero-knowledge
    proofs (ZKP).
</p>
<p>
    Micali, who has always been a researcher, knows about blockchain technology
    and Bitcoin in 2015, and is interested in it. At that point, Micali started
    working on his personal cryptocurrency project, he decided to improve the
    specifications of Bitcoin and Ethereum. This led him to associate with
    Nickolai Zeldavich, a colleague from MIT and who served as Head of
    Distributed Systems at this institution, and who participated in the
    Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).
</p>
<p>
    It is how Algorand was created. Algorand's main objective is to become a
    platform dedicated to offering high-speed decentralized applications
    (DApps) and DeFi that are available to everyone. To achieve this, Algorand
    is a permissionless blockchain. In this way, anyone can be part of it,
    within a transparent system in which everyone can achieve success through
    decentralized projects and applications.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, to deal with the Blockchain Trilemma, Algorand is based
    on a powerful and fast consensus protocol that can be used by any user with
    minimal computational power, who owns $ALGO and is online. All of these
    elements give you the right to be chosen to participate in Algorand's block
    consensus, which is a derivative of the Proof of Stake system.
</p>
<p>
    But along with this, Algorand focuses its development on creating tools
    that facilitate the deployment of decentralized applications and all the
    infrastructure necessary for their operation.
</p>
<h3>
    How does Algorand work?
</h3>
<p>
    As we discussed a moment ago, Algorand is a permissionless blockchain and
    network. This first point is vital to eliminate any type of barrier in the
    use and evolution of the protocol. The main idea behind this principle is
    to guarantee a high level of decentralization, scalability and security.
</p>
<p>
    Second, Algorand's operation is based on a consensus protocol derived from
    Proof of Stake (called Pure Proof of Stake - PPoS). This system is created
    in order to guarantee the full participation of those who are part of the
    network, providing protection and speed. The use of PPoS is framed in
    achieving block production speed measured in a few seconds, which would
    allow a high scalability of the network, thus serving thousands of users
    concurrently, with truly short waiting times and, above all, with very low
    commission costs.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, the Algorand development team has devised new consensus
    algorithms, Byzantine fault-tolerant systems, and an entirely new hashing
    and digital signature system, with a focus on enabling the greatest
    possible scalability.
</p>
<h3>
    Pure Proof of Stake
</h3>
<p>
    The main pillar of Algorand's scalability and speed is its Pure Proof of
    Stake or Proof of Pure Participation (PPoS) protocol. This protocol is a
    derivative of the well-known Proof of Stake (PoS) of other cryptocurrencies
    such as the upcoming Ethereum Merge. The idea of this protocol in Algorand
    is to allow a sufficiently secure resistance to Byzantine faults, while
    providing great speed in the generation and validation of blocks within the
    network. At the same time, PoS is capable of supporting a large number of
    concurrent users and scales well as the network increases in number of
    validators.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/algorand/gov.jpg" alt="Governance Period 3">
    <span class="caption text-muted">The main dates for the third Governance period are included above</span>
</p>
<h3>
    Algorand Governance
</h3>
<p>
    Before introducing the Governance period, we have described how Algorand
    works and the different benefits. Furthermore, the purpose of the
    organization is that everyone has a voice in the future plans of the
    network. The Algorand Governance first period started on 1 October 2021 and
    each of these periods last 3 months.
</p>
<p>
    This is done with a term called “Governor.” Governors are responsible for
    the most important economic and political decisions. This is be done
    through regular public votes that the Algorand Foundation will responsibly
    execute for the benefit of the broader ecosystem, based on the decisions of
    these Governors.
</p>
<p>
    It must be noted that Algorand holders are not automatically enrolled in
    the community governance. Algos holders need to go to the governance web
    portal and specify how many Algo tokens they are going to commit in each
    governance period. To participate, governors must sign a transaction
    representing the amount of tokens invested. The governance web portal can
    be used to generate a transaction in the correct format
</p>
<p>
    For keeping your ALGO, you can use your Ledger, Pera Algo, AlgoSigner or My
    Algo wallet. It must be noted that in order to be eligible for the rewards
    paid at the end of the quarter, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The number of ALGO committed for the period cannot decrease
    </li>
    <li>
        You must vote in the voting session for the respective period
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>
    Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
    Via this mechanism, the main objectives of the Governance periods are the
    following:
</p>
<p>
    On one hand, in this period the owners of ALGO who have committed can
    decide on the future steps of the Algorand network and any improvements
    that can be done via voting.
</p>
<p>
    On another hand, by committing the ALGO tokens, the owners are rewarded.
    There are generally 70.5 Billion algos for rewards. These need to be
    distributed between all the committed ALGO. On average, in the recent
    periods the return rate is around 10% per year, which is around 2.5% per
    quarter.
</p>
<p>
    The more total ALGOs are committed, the lower the APY will be. However, the
    main goal of this governance periods is also to make of the Algorand
    ecosystem the future of finance.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, we can also see recent new projects such as AlgoFi that will
    also play a key role in the growth and adoption of Algorand.

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    It’s said that eyes are the soul's reflection and they are totally right.
    Our look can say man things about how we feel, our emotions and our energy.
</p>
<p>
    Nobody can’t disagree to this statement, but then, why we don’t pay
    attention to these two organs and the muscles around them? The technology
    has brought many advantages to our lifestyle. However, With our time
    exposed to screens and different devices, our eyes are suffering much more
    compared to other times in history
</p>
<h2>
    The importance of the eyes
</h2>
<p>
    Think for a moment about your eyes. You use them all the time when
    you're awake. You blink (between 11,000 and 15,000 times a day), you wink,
    you squint when you see the price of the new phone or clothes, you rub them
    when you're tired, etc. All in all, you use them for almost everything.
    These actions occur thanks to the number of tiny muscles that surround our
    eyes.
</p>
<p>
    Around our eyes, There are 22 muscles. called periorbital muscles and these
    muscles allow you to enjoy a wide range of gestures and movements. Besides,
    they have some characteristics that make them peculiar and, above all, they
    are clear indicators of how we feel. For example: when you sleep too
    little, don't drink enough water, your diet is not the best one, you are
    tired or sad, you abuse alcohol or any other substances... the eye contour
    is the first part of our body that shows this problem to the world.
</p>
<h2>
    Sensitive Organs
</h2>
<p>
    The skin around your eyes is the thinnest skin on your face. It is five
    times thinner than the rest of your face, and ten times thinner than that
    of other parts of the body. That means it has hardly any sebaceous glands
    and no supporting tissue, which is basically collagen. Therefore, it droops
    sooner.
</p>
<p>
    This causes this area to break down more quickly, leading to wrinkles known
    as crow's feet, and eyelid sagging.
</p>
<h2>
    The impact of sun
</h2>
<p>
    We have just described that the part of the eyes is very sensitive since it
    is a very thin skin. Therefore, it has fewer layers underneath and, exposed
    to Ultraviolet rays. This results in what is known as hyperpigmentation.
    Another cause of this unfortunate coloration is genetics; there are simply
    people who naturally have more dark circles under their eyes than others.
</p>
<p>
    Although fluid retention occurs to women in other parts of the body, in men
    this problem occurs in the eyes are. That’s when appear the feared dreaded
    bags as we get older.
</p>
<p>
    Aging is another critical factor for us. When you are young, the membrane
    is responsible for retaining the fat in the eyelids. But when we gain
    weight or older, the eyes membrane gets thinner and loses strength over
    time,
</p>
<h2>
    How to protect them?
</h2>
<p>
    All in all, we can say that the skin around the eye contour is the thinnest
    in the human body, it has a small number of sebaceous glands and its blood
    microcirculation is very slow. As a result, it is fragile, dehydrates
    easily and accumulates toxins quickly. In addition, and due to constant
    muscle contractions, it is the first area where signs of fatigue or aging
    become visible.
</p>
<p>
    We have seen the different problems men have when it comes to eyes and the
    areas surrounding it. Since it is a very sensitive area, we are exposed to
    the sun, and high-resolution screens, we need to find some ways to protect
    and repair the damage.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, a good diet, sleeping at least 8 hours or drinking enough water
    are of the utmost importance. However, without recurring to cosmetic
    surgery, there are some products that can be our allies to mitigate these
    problems.

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    The world of crypto assets or cryptocurrencies is an ever-changing process
    that, like many others, is looking for the next big trend to continue
    generating digital and real value. This new trend could be Staking, the
    method that rewards users based on the number of coins they back the
    blockchain with. Staking comes from the Proof-Of-Stake, the consensus
    mechanism used in some of the crypto currency networks. Through
    proof-to-stake, some investors are already earning quite considerable
    annual percentage return while generating substantial passive income
    without efforts.
</p>
<h2>
    PoW vs PoS
</h2>
<p>
    Currently, both bitcoin and ether rely on miners to complete complex
    puzzles to validate transactions and create new coins. This process is
    known as proof-of-work (PoW) and requires an enormous amount of energy,
    having negative consequences in the environment. The reason is that for
    this validation process, the PoW consumes a high number of fossil fuels.
    Other cryptos, such as Solana or Algorand, already operate with
    proof-of-stake (PoS), with also quite reasonable returns.
</p>
<p>
    Specifically, the PoS process allows users to validate transactions based
    on the number of coins they contribute or wager. The more coins they wager,
    the higher the probability of validation. This reward can include an annual
    percentage return, and the exact amount depends on the blockchain
    technology used. In addition, Proof of Stake is considered the most
    environmentally friendly option nowadays.
</p>
<p>
    So far, we can distinguish between the following validation mechanisms for
    which the most known tokens are included below:
</p>
<h3>
    Proof of Work
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Bitcoin
    </li>
    <li>
        Ethereum
    </li>
    <li>
        Dogecoin
    </li>
    <li>
        Litecoin
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Proof of Stake
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Solana
    </li>
    <li>
        Cardano
    </li>
    <li>
        Algorand
    </li>
    <li>
        Tezos
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Ethereum Merge
</h2>
<p>
    Ethereum, the blockchain behind ether, could soon launch its long-awaited
    Merge update. The EIP will mean the end of Proof of Work for the Ethereum
    network, transitioning completely to Proof of Stake. Although the final
    schedule for this update is unknown, it is known that it will render
    cryptocurrency mining, based on proof-to-work, obsolete. This process,
    called Beacon, allows users to stake ether to support the blockchain and
    earn returns around 4% to 5%, Some industry experts predict that rewards
    with Merge will range from 7% to 12%.
</p>
<p>
    However, like everything else, staking has some side effects.
    Proof-to-stake essentially bets on the viability of the cryptocurrency
    being staked, so it is subject to the volatility of those digital assets.
    Added to this are potential restrictions on how quickly a cryptocurrency
    can be withdrawn after wagering, certain penalties for not actively
    validating transactions, or minimum amounts required to wager, among other
    issues.
</p>
<p>
    Some myths related to this upgrade are that the high fees of Ethereum will
    be reduced. This is not true and how gas works in Ethereum will not be
    changed. Another misconception was that a new token would be created with
    Ethereum Merge. This is also not true, and Ethereum’s cryptocurrency – ETH
    – will remain the same. In general, the main goal of the Ethereum Merge
    update is making Ethereum cryptographic mining obsolete, reducing its    <strong>environmental impact</strong>, together with enhanced security
    against potential attacks.
</p>
<p>

    <span class="caption text-muted">The main ideas of Ethereum Merge are shown above</span>
</p>
<h2>
    What’s next for Ethereum?
</h2>
<p>
    Having seen that Ethereum is evolving, this can have interesting benefits
    for investors and users. In the past years, the rise of NFTs is also thanks
    to Ethereum. Some astonishing figures have been seen in the news in 2021
    and 2022. However, this is completely another topic
</p>
<p>
    Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has been very concerned about the
    future of the blockchain and the use of NFTs (non-fungible tokens).
    According to him, cryptocurrencies were not created "to play with
    million-dollar monkeys, but to do meaningful things in the real world."
</p>
<p>
    In the face of the somewhat uncontrolled boom in non-fungible tokens,
    Buterin believes that many people are not taking advantage of the true
    potential of ether and its blockchain. In particular, he refers to the NFT
    Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, the collection of primate cartoons that have
    become a status symbol in the digital age and for which more than $1
    million has been paid.
</p>
<p>
    In Buterin's view, Ethereum's potential should be harnessed to change the
    world for the better: from fairer voting systems to urban planning and
    public works projects. In particular, he believes the platform could serve
    as a counterweight to authoritarian governments and even end Silicon
    Valley's stranglehold on the digital lives of millions of people.
</p>
<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    There are several interesting projects out there and you may participate on
    those while generating passive income without many efforts. In this post,
    we have briefly introduced what Ethereum Merge will mean. However, in
    future posts we will describe other cryptocurrencies such as Algorand,
    which already use the PoS validation method.
</p>
<p>
    In general, via Staking, we can benefit of diversification, growing our
    income without big efforts. There are different platforms offering
    different APY for several coins, giving us the possibility of some juicy
    returns without doing nothing. Some of these platforms are Nexo or BlockFi.
    Nonetheless, as promised, we will get into details and see on how we can
    start with this.

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    Since temperatures go up, we are already in Spring, and we will be soon in
    summer, the fashion companies have started adapting their
    collections.
</p>
<p>
    For that reason, Massimo Dutti, as every almost every year, has launcher
    their limited edition for the Spring Summer, with a clear nod to summer and
    fresh style.
</p>
<p>
    Massimo Dutti presented some days ago (end of March) the Limited Edition
    SS22 and it is already available for purchase. For this time, taking
    advantage of the rising temperatures, the collection is set in the Maghreb
    region.
</p>
<p>
    Since this post is mainly about the different new looks and articles, it
    will be shorter than other post of this website
</p>
<p>
    Coming back to the collection, the campaign photography is made by Josh
    Olins and the thematic for this campaign is linen, nature, and summery
    vibes. That’s why most of the shots are taken in desert landscapes of the
    North African region.
</p>
<p>
    In this collection, Massimo Dutti focuses on the main characteristics, with
    no specific preference:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Purity and nature
    </li>
    <li>
        Sharp silhouettes
    </li>
    <li>
        Natural colors
    </li>
    <li>
        Nods to Craftsmanship
    </li>
    <li>
        Light garments
    </li>
    <li>
        Comfortable fabrics
    </li>
    <li>
        Classic patterns
    </li>
    <li>
        Avant garde point of view
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These attributes are aligned with the brand’s principles and culture. At
    the same time, Massimo Dutti still bets on the look of a sober man with
    classic taste, as well as cosmopolitan and open to change. You can see also
    this culture applied in other campaigns such as the Join Life collections
</p>
<p>
    The preferred materials are also focused on nature and adapt to warmer
    months of the year. That’s why MD has opted for materials such as linen,
    leather, or different blends of knitwear.
</p>
<p>
    Aligned with choice of the materials and landscapes, they try to evoke non
    artificial man. As opposed to other brands, it is difficult that you will
    see synthetic materials in the fabrics, and you will mainly see natural
    fabrics such as the ones mentioned for this collection.
</p>
<h2>
    My favorite pieces of the collection
</h2>
<p>
    In this post, I am selecting the most charismatic and unique pieces from
    this collection. However, I invite you to visit the website to find any
    other garment that could be interesting for you too.
</p>
<h3>
    Navy Blue Linen Blazer
</h3>
<p>
    The pandemic is being normalized and even if some of us are already back in
    the office, I would also expect that progressively most of us have to go to
    the office. For summer months, I remember that it was a nightmare to wear
    suits in hot places such as Spain or Greece. For these specific climates,
    linen suits and blazers may be a good alternative for work and events.
</p>
<p>
    If you go for lighter fabrics and materials, this will fix the problem and
    you will wear the suit or blazer more comfortably as well as a great style.
</p>
<p>
    Single breasted is still the preferred choice for most men. However, this
    double-breasted blazer can be a good item to distinguish from other typical
    suits. You can combine with the trousers of the same blazer or with more
    casual garments such as jeans.
</p>
<p>

    </a></span>
</p>
<h3>
    Leather toiletry bag
</h3>
<p>
    This collection also adds interesting and high-quality accessories. For
    your home or when you are on trip, it’s a good idea to invest in a good
    toiletry bag.
</p>
<p>
    This one is made on leather with an elegant pattern, and it is big enough
    to put all the things you need before and after shower. For similar items
    from more famous brands, you will pay 5 – 10 times more.
</p>

<h3>
    Suede overshirt
</h3>
<p>
    The next item is delicate, and you should not use it for rainy days.
    However, wearing a suede overshirt will elevate your look. Besides, you can
    also combine this garment in multiple ways. As mentioned, this is the most
    delicate item of the list, but if you have the chance this is a good
    investment for your wardrobe.

<h3>
    Leather Espadrilles
</h3>
<p>
    The known as Alpargatas in Spain, it is a typical product from Spain, used
    in this country, the south of France and some regions of America. Known as
    a humble shoe and evolved from the Egyptian and Roman sandals, Massimo
    Dutti has redesigned this shoe for this collection. This model is kept
    simple, but adds some sophisticated final touches, resembling in some cases
    the woven design of Bottega Venetta.

<h3>
    Beige Shawl collar cardigan
</h3>
<p>
    The weather is getting warmer and drier, but on summer night, we will need
    to add some layers depending on where we are. Wearing a wool or cashmere
    sweater in the months of summer may be excessive. Instead, trusting in
    lighter materials such as cotton would make a great balance. This shawl
    collar cardigan can be the great choice for these cases and as you can see
    the color is also more appropriate for these months.

<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    Normally, I prefer the Autumn / Winter season, since the one for Spring /
    Summer you have less options. In Winter, it is also more common that we
    have more layers and that’s why we have more options to play with.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of the women collection, you will of course have more
    alternatives. However, I’m sure you can find something interesting in this
    collection too.
</p>
<p>
    We have focused in the 5 most interesting pieces of the collection for me,
    but as said, I’m sure you can also find your next hidden gem when visiting
    these links.

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    Intermittent fasting brings several benefits in different aspects such as
    health, recovery, or weight loss. While this trend has been very famous recently in the western culture,
    there are some benefits of the 16/8 rule (26 hours fasting and 8 hours for having meals).
    Due to the different advantages, some different cultures of the world have been applying this for centuries.
</p>
<p>
    In this post we discuss some of the benefits that intermittent fasting can
    bring to our life. We had also tried to validate most of the benefits with
    some scientific studies.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from the different tests, I have been using this for many years now
    and I can tell you that my health and my state of form has improved during
    this time. Here are some benefits for the long-term that fasting could
    bring to your life.
</p>
<h2>
    Weight and fat
</h2>
<p>
    Many people who try <a name="OLE_LINK1"></a>    <a name="OLE_LINK2">intermittent </a>fasting do so to lose weight. In
    general, intermittent fasting will cause you to eat fewer meals and
    therefore, a reduction of calories.
</p>
<p>
    Unless you offset this by eating a lot more during other meals, you will
    end up consuming fewer calories. Further, intermittent fasting improves
    hormone function to facilitate weight loss.
</p>
<p>
    Lower levels of insulin, higher levels of MBH, and higher amounts of
    norepinephrine (noradrenaline) increase the breakdown of body fat and
    facilitate its use to generate energy. For this reason, short-term fasting
    increases the metabolic rate, helping burn even more calories than in
    normal situations.
</p>
<p>
    In other words, intermittent fasting has two functions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It increases your metabolic rate
    </li>
    <li>
        It reduces the amount of food you eat
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    According to a 2014 review of the scientific research, intermittent fasting
    can cause a weight loss of 3 percent to 8 percent in 3 to 24 weeks. This
    amount is huge.
</p>
<p>
    A 2011 review also showed that intermittent fasting caused less muscle loss
    than continuous calorie restriction.
</p>
<h2>
    Sugar and Diabetes
</h2>
<p>
    Diabetes 2 is one of the diseases growing faster in the last decade. Its
    main characteristic is high blood sugar levels in the context of insulin
    resistance.
</p>
<p>
    Anything that reduces insulin resistance should help lower blood sugar
    levels and protect against type 2 diabetes. Intermitting fasting can help
    with this.
</p>
<p>
    For example, intermittent fasting has been shown to have major benefits for
    insulin resistance and cause an impressive reduction in blood sugar levels.
</p>
<p>
    In human studies on intermittent fasting, fasting blood sugar was reduced
    by 3 percent to 6 percent over the course of 8 to 12 weeks in people with
    prediabetes. Fasting insulin was reduced by 20 percent to 31 percent.
</p>
<p>
    What does this mean? intermittent fasting may be highly protective for
    people who are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/fasting/fasting-book.jpg" alt="Multiple Benefits">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Although it may take some time to get adapted, fasting brings multiple benefits</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Heart
</h2>
<p>
    Coronary problems and heart disease is currently the disease killing most
    people in the world. Related to this problem, several risk factors are
    known to be associated with an increased or decreased risk of heart
    disease.
</p>
<p>
    Intermittent fasting has been shown to improve several different risk
    factors, including:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
        blood sugar levels
    </li>
    <li>
        blood pressure
    </li>
    <li>
        blood triglycerides
    </li>
    <li>
        (bad) cholesterol
    </li>
    <li>
        inflammatory markers
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>
    Cellular Recovery
</h2>
<p>
    When we fast, the body's cells initiate a cellular "waste disposal" process
    called autophagy.
</p>
<p>
    This process involves cells breaking down and metabolizing broken and
    dysfunctional proteins that accumulate within cells over time.
</p>
<p>
    Increased autophagy may protect against several diseases, including cancer
    and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
</p>
<h2>
    Brain
</h2>
<p>
    We have discussed different benefits and advantages for our body. What is
    good for the body is often also good for the most important organ, our
    brain.
</p>
<p>
    Intermittent fasting improves several metabolic functions that are known to
    be important for brain health.
</p>
<p>
    Intermittent fasting helps to reduce:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        blood sugar levels
    </li>
    <li>
        oxidative stress
    </li>
    <li>
        inflammation
    </li>
    <li>
        insulin resistance
    </li>
    <li>
        Fasting also increases levels of a brain hormone called brain-derived
        neurotrophic factor (BDNF). A deficiency of BDNF has been implicated in
        depression and various other brain problems.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Other studies have also shown that intermittent fasting protects against
    brain damage due to stroke.
</p>
<h2>
    Hormones
</h2>
<p>
    When you don't eat for a period of time, several things happen in your body
    related to the hormones and internal organs.
</p>
<p>
    For example, your body changes hormone levels to make stored body fat more
    accessible and initiate important cellular repair and recovery processes.
</p>
<p>
    These are some of the hormones changes that occur thanks to fasting:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Insulin levels. Insulin levels in the blood drop significantly, making
        it easier to burn fat.
    </li>
    <li>
        Human growth hormone (HGH) levels. Blood levels of human growth hormone
        (HGH) can increase dramatically. Higher levels of this hormone make it
        easier to burn fat and build muscle and have many other benefits.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cellular repair. The body induces important cellular repair processes,
        such as removing waste from cells.
    </li>
    <li>
        Gene expression. There are beneficial changes in several genes and
        molecules related to longevity and disease protection.
    </li>
    <li>
        Many of the benefits of intermittent fasting are related to these
        changes in hormones and cells
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Stress
</h2>
<p>
    Oxidative stress is one of the steps towards aging and many chronic
    diseases. We all want to avoid this. It involves unstable molecules called
    free radicals. Free radicals react with and damage other important
    molecules, such as protein and DNA.
</p>
<p>
    Several studies show that intermittent fasting can improve the body's
    resistance to oxidative stress. In addition, studies show that intermittent
    fasting can help fight inflammation, another key component in many common
    diseases.
</p>
<h2>
    Cancer
</h2>
<p>
    Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and it’s also one of
    the most problematic diseases.
</p>
<p>
    Fasting has been shown to have several beneficial effects on metabolism
    that may reduce the risk of cancer.
</p>
<p>
    Promising evidence from animal studies indicates that intermittent fasting
    or diets that mimic fasting may help prevent cancer. Research in humans has
    had similar findings, although more studies are needed. There is also some
    evidence that fasting reduced several side effects of chemotherapy in
    humans.
</p>
<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    Although we have been taught that breakfast is the most important of the
    day, this is due to the interest of the food industry in the past decades.
    We should forget about this myth and follow what it’s good for our body.
</p>
<p>
    Related to some questions you may have questions about what you can do and
    cannot do.
    It’s perfectly fine to drink water, coffee, or tea as long as you don’t put
    sugar. Furthermore, it is also fine to put a small amount of milk.
</p>
<p>
    Probably the hardest time is starting with the intermittent fasting and it
    may not be made for every person. I can just tell my experience about it
    and the different noticeable that has brought to me. I hope this can be of
    any use to you in your life. In this post we have seen different benefits
    and you may also take this into account if you would like to start with it.

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    While everybody is waiting for the most anticipated games in 2022 and it
    seems that it will be one of the best years in history with the likes of
    God of War: <strong>Ragnarok</strong>, <strong>Elden Ring</strong> or <strong>Horizon Forbidden West</strong>, today we are
    discussing some modern classics. Some of them were already released some
    years ago.
</p>
<p>
    All of them are playable in PS4 and in some cases you can also play in the
    PS5. The good news is that since they were released many years ago, you
    will find them for a very good price. If you are play too many games per year this article may not add much, but if you are a casual gamer like me, you may have missed some of these.
</p>
<h2>
    The Witcher 3
</h2>
<p>
    While the Witcher 1 and Witcher 2 don’t have a great mechanisms and
    controls, The Witcher 3 was a total breakthrough. Apart from continuing
    with a great story, it finally added a fantastic gameplay. It is still
    considered a total piece of art from the Polish company CD Projekt Red.
    These games count the adventures of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher – person
    whose job is killing monsters – who deals with different situations,
    monsters, characters, etc.
</p>
<p>
    In this game, the main enemy is the Wild Hunt- evil elf riders from
    another world -, trying to look for Ciri and you will have to protect her.
    This game also means the end of the story told in the 3 Witcher games. For
    that reason, it is not likely that there will be another game.
</p>
<p>
    If the main game was not enough, there are not 1 but 2 expansions
    available.
</p>
<p>
    The expansions are also excellent, and they are completely different one
    from another
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Hearts of the Stone</strong> focuses on a dark and more mystic adventure. In
        this one, Gerald will meet a mysterious man called Gaunter O’Dimm. Via
        this person, you will be asked to defeat a bandit called Olgierd von
        Everec, who is said to be immortal. The story is based mainly on these
        characters, but you will have to deal with new creatures and different
        mysteries.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Blood and Wine</strong> is the last expansion, set in Toussaint, where the
        landscape will remind you of France or Italy. In this city, you are
        asked by Duchess of Toussaint Anna Henrietta to solve the mystery of different killings
        in this region recently.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In the main game and the expansions, you will have the option to choose
    different paths and all the choices you make will have an in important
    impact on how the story evolves
</p>
<p>
    Related to the main game, it could be good to read some summaries of
    previous games (there is no need to play them) to know what’s going on, the
    different regions and allies or enemies. For this, watching the Netflix
    series will not help much since they are set in different times.

</p>
<h2>
    God of War
</h2>
<p>
    The creators of the God of War saga, Santa Monica Studio, made a great
    transition from their unique hack and slash style included in previous
    games with multiple changes in the last game. Further, it is undeniable
    that all these modifications in the gameplay improved the experience,
    taking profit of the latest consoles.
</p>
<p>
    Not just the gameplay changed, but also where the story is set. Kratos has
    changed Greece for Norway, where he will have to take care of his son,
    Atreus.
    Although I prefer the Greek mythology compared to the Norse one, there was
    not much to see since Kratos had killed almost every Greek god.
</p>
<p>
    Not just in the gameplay or the ambient you can see differences, but in the
    personality of the protagonist. Less selfish and more mature, you can see
    a clear evolution of the character if you have played the first games.
</p>
<p>
    The ghost of Sparta will meet new “friends” such as Baldur, Freya, Magni,
    Modi or Mimir. Apart from these Norse gods, the creatures are such trolls,
    dark elves or draugrs or even dragons. However, the most difficult part of
    the game – if you want to do so - is defeating the 9 Valkyries of the game.
</p>
<p>
    To defeat these enemies, you will also notice that your trusted blades of
    chaos are not anymore with you, and you are using a new weapon: an axe.
    However, as the game advances, you will have to recover the blades of chaos
    in order to defeat new enemies. You will have to guide Kratos through the
    different 6 playable realms
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Misgard
    </li>
    <li>
        Alfheim
    </li>
    <li>
        Helheim
    </li>
    <li>
        Jotunheim
    </li>
    <li>
        Muspelheim
    </li>
    <li>
        Nilfheim
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We are all waiting for the continuation of this game Ragnarok, which is to
    be released end of 2022. Apart from Thor, who know which other gods we will
    see there. Further, in the new game, we will be able to play in the realms
    that were not playable in the previous delivery: Vanaheim, Svartalfheim,
    and Asgard.
</p>
<p>
    In the meantime, if you like the Nordic culture, you may also try Assassins
    Creed Valhalla or check the gameplay below.

<h2>
    The Last of Us
</h2>
<p>
    I have never a fan of zombie, horror, or similar games. However, I bought
    The Last of Us by chance (there was a good offer) having seen the reviews.
    To be honest, I did not have a clue what was it about until I started
    playing it.
</p>
<p>
    This game tells the story of Joel, who is the main character, and Ellie is
    the girl you have to protect. Through the trip and the different
    apocalyptic places, you visit, you will also meet some old friends.
</p>
<p>
    The reason for having to protect her is that I have forgotten to say that
    most humans have an infection (Cordyceps brain infection). For that reason,
    they have become insane, and they attack also non-infected humans. That’s
    why also the status of the different places you visit.
</p>
<p>
    In the story you will find different types of infected who have different
    skills depending on the phase they are (Runners, Stalkers, Clickers, and
    Bloaters)
</p>
<p>
    IF you play at night, with the narrative and sounds, you will undoubtfully
    feel this sensation in any other game (except in the second part of this
    game)
</p>
<p>
    Where the variety of enemies is not as high as in the Witcher or God of War
    (the enemies are the infected and other humans), playing the game is like
    reading a good book or watching a move, where you are expecting to see
    what’s coming next.
</p>
<p>
    The adrenaline when running away from the infected ones, the dramatic turn
    of events, or the ingenuity you must use to defeat the enemies makes this
    game special. Even if it’s the oldest one in the list, the gameplay has not
    aged badly at all.
</p>
<p>
    I have the Last of Us 2 since a few months, but I did not have to play it.
    I cannot wait to do so and probably it could be one of the games that
    should be worth to mention.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, HBO is also preparing series about this where Pedro Pascal
    will play the role of Joel. We cannot wait to see this.
</p>
<p>
    Even if you are not the person who likes this type of games, I would
    encourage you to check some videos and try it.
</p>
<p>
    <iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="yes" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HawhjjF5qFc" title="First minutes of the Last Of Us" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<h2>
    Uncharted 4
</h2>
<p>
    We finalize the list from another game from Naughty Dog. Uncharted 4 is the
    last game of the uncharted saga if you don’t take into account the
    expansion Lost Legacy. The fourth game is still about Nathan Drake, but
    this time he is retired as treasure hunter and adventurer. However, he will
    get soon get disturbed to do one final mission in order to help his
    brother.
</p>
<p>
    In the fourth game of the saga, you will have to search for English pirate
    Henry Avery’s treasure. To do so, you will visit many different locations.
    That’s why you will be able to see gorgeous landscapes, use different ways
    of transport and research in countries such as Panama, Madagascar. Scotland
    or Italy.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from the main timeline, there will be some missions set in the past,
    shown as flashbacks to better understand the story.:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You will for example be in a jail in Panama with your brother Samuel
        and your partner Rafe. This time is set before the events of the first
        game.
    </li>
    <li>
        You will also play a young Nathan when he was at the orphanage in
        Boston.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Although my preferred game is the second one, because of all the changes
    that brought to the series, the fourth and probably last game of the series
    is the most complete one in terms of graphics, visuals, and gameplay. It is
    also the one that closes the circle.
</p>
<p>
    As it occurs in The Last of Us, here you will just fight against humans (in
    previous games you will have to deal with some specific creatures, but I
    will not say more). However, this does not mean that it is worse. As it
    occurs with The Last of Us, here you will see a twisted story, different
    puzzles to be solved and some unexpected events that will hook you to your
    sofa.
</p>
<p>
    Sadly for the fans, the title “A Thief’s End” also may indicate that there
    will be no more Uncharted, unless there is another protagonist. There has
    been recently a film without very good reviews. However, whatever Naughty
    Dog is working on now, it will be a candidate for sure to be included in a
    similar list in the near future.
</p>

<h2>Other Classics Coming Soon</h2>

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    Some posts ago we talked about different stores and brands. In those cases,
    the prices were mainly affordable since the brands, although offer very
    good quality, they are far from being considered luxury brands.
</p>
<p>
    In this article, I present you 4 Italian brands that are the
    exemplification of classic, sophisticated style combined with a delicate
    treatment of the different materials. They have been for some years
    selecting the best materials, and while other brands have preferred to
    focus on other aspects such as the latest trends, finding the best fabrics
    around the world continues to be one of th
    brands.
</p>
<p>
    The prices are of course high, but as opposed to other brands, when it
    comes to the attention to details, quality of fabric and country of
    manufacturing, this can of course be a valid justification.
</p>
<h2>
    Zegna
</h2>
<p>
    One of the staples from Zegna is the suit. Founded in the north of Italy,
    Trivero more specifically, Ermenegildo Zegna created the company in the
    1910s. However, he did not do this alone and his two brothers Mario and
    Edoardo helped him with the task of creating the company and its vision.
    The objective from Zegna was already clear in its inception, more than 100
    years ago:
</p>
<p>
    On one hand, they wanted to always find the best fabrics for each garment
    and each occasion. For that, they used to track different regions in search
    of the best product
</p>
<p>
    On another hand, innovation was already an important pillar of the company,
    combining it together with the best fabrics.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately for the consumers, the vision of the original founder remains
    unchanged today and they have not been transitioned to other styles or
    politics, as it has happened unfortunately with other classic houses.
</p>
<p>
    In Zegna, all materials such as wool and cashmere are carefully selected so
    they are perfect for suits and sweaters. Nonetheless, you will see
    exquisite products such as ties, shirts, or accessories to complete one
    man’s wardrobe.
</p>
<p>
    Although their style is classic, keeping the traditional tailoring as a
    service, called <em>Su Misura</em>, they also have collaborated with other
    brands on the crest of the wave, such as <strong>Fear of God</strong>. Further, thanks to different technologies they have also created the <strong>Tech Merino</strong> collection.
</p>
<p>
    Although the prices are in the top, it is possible to see the quality of
    the different garments from miles away, and you will not be wrong if you go
    for this option.
</p>
<p>

    <span class="caption text-muted"> You can find <a href="https://www.zegna.com/">Zegna</a> in their website or
    other pages such as Mr Porter</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Canali
</h2>
<p>
    2 hours away from Trivero, close to Monza, Canali was founded just a few
    years before the second world war in Triuggio. It was founded by two
    brothers: Giacomo and Giovanni Canali, and the family still plays an
    important role in the company today. A family-owned based company, the
    focus on Canali lies on traditional menswear such as knitwear, suits, and
    shoes.
</p>
<p>
    The idea behind Canali is to keep a classic style but modernize it with
    minor enhancements constantly, also adapting the look to the contemporary
    times. They call it <strong>“modern elegance”</strong> and this term is very appropriate in
    his blog.
</p>
<p>
    Customers also play an important role in Canali’s history and they are
    important for them regardless of who they are. As it occurs with Zegna,
    they also offer an exclusive made to measure service, so you can see that
    the classic style is one of their signatures.
</p>
<p>
    Although it has less history than Zegna, and it is also probably less known,
    you cannot go wrong either if you decide to visit the shop from the
    province of Monza.
</p>

    <span class="caption text-muted">   Modern Elegance is how <a href="https://www.canali.com/">Canali</a> define their style and you can see an example
    above.</span>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2>
    E. Marinella
</h2>
<p>
    Since we have introduced two Italian brands from the north, it would be
    fair also to travel to see a different style from the South of Italy. And
    not, we are not checking Dolce &amp; Gabbana or similar. This brand is
    rather unknown and due to the relaxation of the outfits in last years
    (COVID-19 may have something to do), it may have lost presence in the
    recent years.
</p>
<p>
    We are talking about E. Marinella, which was found as Zegna in the 1910s.
    However, the company was created in Naples, where they started with a tiny
    20-meter shop. Marinella means “From the Sea” in Italian and you could
    guess that the shop is related to the Gulf of Naples or the Mediterranean
    Sea. However, the company owes its name to the creator Eugenio Marinella.
</p>
<p>
    However, if you don’t know E. Marinella is focused mainly on ties and
    handkerchiefs and what they wanted to achieve was replicating some of the
    British products and style in Italy. Since the usage of ties is less common
    nowadays, that’s why it may not be as famous one as the other brands listed
    here.
</p>
<p>
    As it occurs with Zegna and Canali, E. Marinella is focused on two
    different aspects:
</p>
<p>
    <strong> Materials </strong>: The characteristic prints and pattern of the ties are designed
    carefully and produced with the best silk prepared exclusively just for
    them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> Craftsmanship </strong>: Although they have invested in different technological
    machinery, some part of the fabrication is still manual, where the works
    prepare the ties with the utmost care. The ties are folded 5, 7 or 9 times to
    themselves, and you can note it when touching them.
</p>
<p>
    Although the format attire is losing more and more presence, we all must
    attend special occasions. For these events, the ties from E Marinella will
    for sure elevate your outfit and you will create an excellent impression to
    the hosts and other guests.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/italy/marinella.jpg" alt="Unique category of products">
    <span class="caption text-muted">    Even if it is just a picture, you can notice the quality of the ties from    <a href="https://www.emarinella.eu/">E. Marinella</a>.
    above.</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Bottega Veneta
</h2>
<p>
    This one is probably the most famous company, especially for women. If you
    know about Italian, you can see that in this case the name is quite simple:
    Bottega means shop and Veneta means Venetian – yes, we have come back to
    the North of Italy for this last section -. This is the only company listed
    in this post that does not have the origin in the founder of the company.
</p>
<p>
    As opposed to other brands, Bottega Veneta is focused more on women’s
    attires, or at least they have more options. Nonetheless, since we have
    already talked about different garments, it’s the time to focus on
    accessories for the daily activities. Bags, wallets, backpacks. This way,
    we complete the list, and we can have an outlook composed of just these
    brands.
</p>
<p>
    Their instant hit was the Intreciatto leather, technique that had been
    tried to replicate or imitated in some brands. It’s also the main
    characteristic today, giving the different accessories a unique feel.
    Intrecciato is called like that because of the way the leather is weaved.
    In the past, in the region the company was created, they were used to work
    just with clothes and the machinery were adapted to garments. In order to
    be able to recycle these machines, the leather had to be super thin. Once
    completed, the workers had to wove with this characteristic pattern to make
    the accessory more resistant.
</p>
<p>
    Although them were acquired 20 years ago approximately, they have not been
    corrupted and they have kept their unique design and exquisite
    craftsmanship. You can also see some of these pieces of art below.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/italy/bottega.jpg" alt="Intrecciatto is their signature">
    <span class="caption text-muted">        Classic and unique is what accessories from    <a href="http://www.bottegaveneta.com/">Bottega Veneta</a> are.
    above.</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Alla prossima
</h2>
<p>
    There are more Italian and non-Italian brands to come. For example, there
    are some brands from Italy which will be included in the future are the
    ones like <a href="https://www.bogliolimilano.com/">Boglioli</a>,<a href="https://www.corneliani.com/">Corneliani</a>,<a href="https://www.palzileri.com/fr/">Pal Zileri</a> or    <a href="https://www.slowear.com/">Incotex</a> (Slowear group). For the
    moment, we have seen a few and I hope that you have discovered at least one
    interesting company.

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    When it comes to accessories, I’m of the opinion that men should keep it
    simple. When I was young, I was taught that jewels are for women. On the
    other hand, men should keep it simple. There are different reasons for
    that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Too many accessories will steal attention to your look.
    </li>
    <li>
        Less is more when it comes to men’s fashion. Keep it simple.
    </li>
    <li>
        Unless you are a rapper, probably putting too many accessories will not
        look nice in your daily activities.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    From what you have read, you may already guess that I am not a fan rings,
    earrings or necklaces on men’s looks. However, a watch is something that
    every man should try to wear.
</p>
<p>
    Affordable or exclusive, some watches are undeniable icons and pieces of
    art. In next posts, I will talk about more affordable watches and modern
    classics. However, in this one we focus on models with some history and
    that unfortunately the price may also be exorbitant in some cases. This
    means that they are not for all pockets and even if so, you may prefer to
    spend that money in something else or investing as explained in this
    article.
</p>
<p>
    Here it is a small description of each watch, but you will not see any
    price listed. Please note that for some of them, there is a waiting list
    which could be excessive.
</p>
<h2>
    Rolex submariner
</h2>
<p>
    Introduced in the 1950s, the Submariner Is probably the most famous watch
    in the luxury models. Although it had seen several improvements in terms of
    movements and water resistance, it has kept is essence. Due to its
    versatility and the good marketing, many brands used this design to create
    similar divers.
</p>
<p>
    One of the most know famous campaigns was in the James Bond movies: Dr No
    and From Russia with Love. It remains a classic nowadays and there are
    different versions, material, and colors of it.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from inspiring models from other brands, Rolex has also created new
    models out of the Submariner. A clear example of this is the <strong>Sea-Dweller</strong> introduced in the late 1960s.
</p>
<p>
    For the stated reasons, it is probably one of the most recognizable watches
    in the planet. Since it’s a classic, it may take some time until you can
    buy it from your authorized dealer. On the other hand, we have already said
    that many brands have used this model as inspiration. For this reason,
    there are some alternatives in case you are looking for something more
    affordable
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Orient Mako
    </li>
    <li>
        Casio Duro
    </li>
    <li>
        Omega Seamaster
    </li>
</ul>
<p>

    <span class="caption text-muted">The Rolex Sea-Dweller is the muscled version of the Submariner</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Audemars Piguet Royal Oak
</h2>
<p>
    The watch house from Le Brassus owes too much to the Royal Oak model.
    Mainly, because without this model, the company would probably not exist
    today. In the 1970’s the Swiss company realized that they would go bankrupt
    if they did not introduce a disrupting model. It was in full era of the
    quartz crisis, triggered by Japanese makers when Audemars Piguet realized
    that they had to disrupt the market.
</p>
<p>
    At that time, the watch company hired Gerald Genta to create something
    unique and completely different to previous watches the house had created.
    This was the creation of a steel sports watch, integrated into a bracelet
    and completely in stainless steel.
</p>
<p>
    Although Audemars Piguet had already a reputation back then, and focused on
    classic dress watches, the Royal Oak is the insignia from this house.
    Today, there are multiple versions of this watch, such as limited editions.
    Furthermore, other companies have taken inspirate from this model.
    Initially just in stainless steel, you may find different variations of
    this model in precious metals, alligator, or rubber strap.
</p>
<p>
    The Royal Oak has appreciated in the last years and the waiting list
    average is 8 years. For that reason, these are some alternatives in
    different price ranges.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        G Shock GA-2100 (Casioak)
    </li>
    <li>
        Tissot PRX Powermatic 80
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/watches/ap.jpg" alt="Blue Royal Oak">
    <span class="caption text-muted">The model with the blue dial is the most iconic version of this watch</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Zenith el Primero
</h2>
<p>
    Although it is not considered in the top tier list of watches, it’s one of
    the most famous watch companies and Zenith has indeed a lot of horological
    history.
</p>
<p>
    However, as it occurs with many topics, the model we are discussing today
    was a total failure on the early stages and there are different reasons for
    this unsatisfactory project.
</p>
<p>
    Zenith started developing some years before the release the first automatic
    chronograph. They released it finally in 1969, with a total project
    duration of 7 years. Just before the release, on the same year, other two
    companies release a Chronograph, being Seiko and Chronographic in that
    order. For that reason. It is not correct to call it “El Primero” (the
    first one). Nonetheless, out of these 3 chronographs, El Primero is the
    most sophisticated and complex one. That’s why it included in the history
    books, and you can find today different versions and reinterpretations of
    it, such as the Skeleton version.
</p>
<p>
    It’s not as sporty as the other models, but you can put it with almost
    anything. In case you would like to buy it, it is less exclusive than the
    other ones listed in this post. You can even buy it from Mr Porter, shop
    that was included in this <a href="https://mrfreire.net/2022/03/06/shops-for-the-modern-man-part-I/">post</a>post. If you want to look for alternative
    chronographs, some of models that are similar to El Primero are the following ones:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Rolex Daytona - this is pricier than the Zenith Model and we will talk
        soon about it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Orient panda
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/watches/zen.jpg" alt="Multiple versions">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Multiple reworks and versions of El Primero exist today</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Patek Philippe Nautilus
</h2>
<p>
    Having seen the success of the Royal Oak, another member of the Holy
    Trinity (the other member being Vacheron Constantin) did not want to be
    second to none and they asked the creator of the AP model, Gerald Genta, to
    design a steel and sports watch. If you know about the company from Geneva,
    you will know that they have and were focused on more classic models such
    as the dress watch Calatrava.
</p>
<p>
    Genta was inspired in a ship’s porthole to create the Nautilus, name also
    linked to Captain Nemo’s submarine in the Jules Vern Twenty Thousand
    Leagues Under the Sea novel. When it was created in the mid 70s, the watch
    looked huge and for that reason the success was not immediate. However, the
    undeniable elegant, sporty, and modern design grew slowly on watch lovers
    and has finally become a legend.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, today’s price is even higher than the one of Royal Oak (not
    going into details about the price) if you can afford it. As it occurred
    with the Royal Oak, during these years, there have been different versions
    of the watch in terms of size, caliber, and different limited editions.
    Another top model from this house is the Aquanaut model, which has
</p>
<p>
    The Nautilus is by far the most exclusive watch in this list, but again, we
    are not talking about the price. Furthermore, the waiting list may be
    comparable to the one of the Royal Oak.
</p>
<p>
    Although the design of the Nautilus is unique, here are some alternatives,
    although these ones are not precisely cheap.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Girrard Perregaux Laureato
    </li>
    <li>
        Bulgari Octo Finissimo
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/watches/patek.jpg" alt="Most famous Patek">
    <span class="caption text-muted">The Nautilus is the most famous model of the house and there is a model for every taste</span>
</p>
<h2>
    More classics to come
</h2>
<p>
    We have been talking about classic sport watches that you could wear in
    almost every occasion. You may have noticed that there are no dress watches
    in this list. Although I really like them, like happened with the video
    killing the radio star, sport watches seem to have killed the dress
    watches.
</p>
<p>
    Maybe not killing, but the presence of classic dress watches has been
    reduced considerably in the last years. Who knows if they will be on the top again
    in a few years from now? However, for the moment, we have described 4 more
    sport watches that can also fit with any look. If you wear one of these or
    their alternative modes, there is no need to at all to add any jewel or
    extravagant accessories to your look

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    Cash is less and less used and the different technologies, the regulations
    and COVID-19 have all something to do with this. Although the future may
    not be necessarily in the hands of cards, which are a product that has
    barely evolved in the recent years, they are still the preferred paying
    method.
</p>
<p>
    In this post, we are including the best cards that you can find in the
    market. When I mention the best, I’m referring to the best quality price
    relationship. Therefore, if you are looking for products such as the
    American Express Centurion or alike, you will have to wait.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that due to the banking licenses and regulations, some of these
    cards may not be available in some countries. This is because I just
    recommend what I use, or I have used.
</p>
<h2>
    Revolut
</h2>
<p>
    Revolut is one of the most valuable FinTech in the world and the most
    valuable fintech in UK, where it is based. It’s also probably the most
    famous company in this list.
</p>
<p>
    Aside debit cards, they also offer other financial products such as vaults,
    trading and crypto. However, nothing against these services, but I think
    there are much better options out there if for example you are thinking on
    trading stocks or crypto.
</p>
<p>
    Revolut has been growing exponentially in the last years thanks to their
    inexistent or low fees, application design and associated benefits.
</p>
<p>
    The most known characteristic of Revolut is that there are no currency
    conversion fees on card payments.
</p>
<p>
    Nonetheless, on weekends, the exchange rate fee is increased. In any case,
    even if there are some fees on the weekends, the rate is favorable than
    more traditional services.
</p>
<p>
    Besides, if you use premium, you have unlimited transfer of foreign
    currencies.
    If you are abroad, you can also withdraw money from ATMs, up to a certain
    limit for free.
</p>
<p>
    These characteristics make Revolut the perfect card for travelling and
    short stays in foreign countries. Furthermore, there were some great news
    at the end of 2021 since Revolut was granted the full banking license by
    the European Central Bank.
</p>
<p>
    There are some options (Premium, Metal) for which the service will not be
    free and depending on your situation, it may be worth to check these. For
    example, if you transfer every month considerable amounts of foreign
    currency, it may be important to upgrade. At least on my case, this is more
    beneficial.
</p>
<h3>
    Revolut Business case
</h3>
<p>
    The most obvious case is for travelling to foreign countries, but there are
    many more usages.
</p>

    Compared to other banks, one of the things I like most about Revolut is the
    instant transfer of money. If I transfer to my other accounts, the money is
    there in milliseconds. The other situation relevant on my case is to
    transfer different currencies. For example, if you can just deposit USD in
    your broker (e.g., crypto), this is a way method to transfer your local
    currency into USD without hidden fees.

<h2>
    N26
</h2>
<p>
    The origin of the name comes from the number of smaller cubes in a Rubik’s
    cube. Founded in 2013 in Munich, N26 is a German neobank with a huge
    customer base in Europe and the US.
</p>
<p>
    N26 offers a basic account and a debit card in the entry level. For these
    products, there are no fees. The customer can add more services (N26 You
    and N26 Metal) if needed and for these ones, there will be a monthly fee.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to open the account, the registration will take around 10
    minutes.
</p>
<p>
    ATM withdrawals are also free up to a certain amount per month.
</p>
<p>
    They will also send the card for free when you top up your account for the
    first time. In most countries you can also use your mobile to pay since it
    is compatible with Apple Pay and Google Pay.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of exchange rates, there rate may be slightly worse than the
    ones from Revolut. However, the conversion is constant on all days of the
    week. For foreign currency transfers, they are since a few months with
    Wise.
</p>
<h3>
    N26 Business case
</h3>
<p>
    In my case, I use it as a daily card in Europe. One trick I use is the
    following one. DAZN is a streaming service from Germany and available in
    many locations. However, the offering of DAZN Germany is much better than
    the one for other countries. For that reason, I have an account in DAZN
    Germany and I use my N26 to pay with it, since they detect that it is a
    German bank.
</p>
<h3>
    N26 Features
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Great app
    </li>
    <li>
        No currency conversion fees card
    </li>
    <li>
        Cheap foreign currency transfers
    </li>
    <li>
        Good security management
    </li>
    <li>
        EU banking license
    </li>
    <li>
        Since it is a German account, you may use it to access services in
        Germany (e.g., DAZN DE offers)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    At the moment, there is no current promotion, but you may open an account
    from their <a href="https://n26.com/en-eu">website</a>.

<h2>
    Neon
</h2>
<p>
    The last one in the list is a Swiss digital bank, and it is just restricted
    to people living in Switzerland. Neon offers a bank, a phone application,
    and a debit card. Everything for free. Apart from not having any expenses,
    you can also have up to two ATM withdrawals per month.
</p>
<p>
    Neon is also compatible with Apple Pay and Google Play. On top of this,
    Neon is also compatible with TWINT (if you are in Switzerland, you know
    what this is).
</p>
<p>
    Although Neon does not have a banking license the Hypothekarbank Lenzburg
    manages the different accounts. For that reason, under the Swiss Banking
    Law, the deposited is insured up to 100,000 CHF.
</p>
<p>
    If you are abroad, you don’t pay exchange rate fees in card transactions.
    On the other hand, for cash withdrawals in foreign currency, there is a
    1.5% fee.
</p>
<p>
    Neon also offers a more premium account, which is called Neon Green. The
    features of Neon Green are not focused mainly on the customer, but the
    society. For each Neon Green user, Neon plants 35trees every month.
    Further, for every 100 CHF spent, an additional tree is planted. For
    example, if you spend 4,000 CHF, they will plan 45 trees in one single
    month.
</p>
<p>
    On top of that, you also have an extended warranty of 3 years, thanks that
    they have a partnership with hanks to our partner, Europäische
    Reiseversicherung (ERV) . All this is just for 5 CHF, which makes is quite reasonable.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that even the registration process takes 10 minutes, you will
    need to show residency permit (e.g., if you just arrived in Switzerland).
</p>
<h3>
    Neon Business case
</h3>
<p>
    In my case, if you have Neon Green, you get a 3-year warranty extension for
    all electronic and electrical products. You always have two-year warrant
    for your products, so this means that you will have a total    <strong>warranty of 5 years.</strong> Despite the different technological
    breakthroughs, planned obsolescence is at the order of the day. This way,
    we are more than covered.

<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    In all these cases, for the basic service (account and debit card), there
    are no monthly fees or any disadvantage for using them. In my case I have
    all of these, but you can of course select just the one that suits you
    best. In case of emergency card, it is always a possibility to have others.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the promotions may vary from time to time and the amounts
    may also be bigger or lower. In all cases, if any reward, you and I get the
    same amount. However, the purpose of this article is just showing different
    advantages and help people move away from other banks with abusive fees and
    less benefits.
