    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    <p>
        While our life is easier compared to some years ago in many aspects, the
        first world has also led to new trends, problems, or even diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unknown or ignored in the past in the past, the importance of our mental
        health is taking the attention it deserves. We need to understand that
        there are few important things that our mind and body. Not taking care of
        it, may lead to several issues in our behavior, thinking or mood.
</div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Stress can be characterized as a response to any occasion which is seen,
        deliberately or unknowingly, as a danger to our safety or happiness. Stress
        which we experience as unmanageable can be detected as injury by our
        sensory system and become part of ourselves, damaging our body
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are some of my tricks to make sure that we fight back and defeat our
        worst fears and the general stress from our life.
    </p>
<p class="big">
<hr class="bigHr">
</p>
    <h3>
        1. HIIT
    </h3>
    <p>
        Low intensity training may be boring and will not cause much an impact once
        done. However, if we switch to high intensity interval training, in just
        20-minute sessions we will not just achieve more than in the low-paced
        session, but it will also help generate more hormones.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of these hormones involved in the process is cortisol. Cortisol is
        known to handle stress
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, if you are changing to go to the next level when it comes to
        your workout, this may also help reduce the stress.
    </p>
    <p>
        As with anything, everything in excess is bad. Therefore, too much workout
        will also not be the best option for de-stressing, because it will also
        have negative impact in our cortisol levels, being these too high.
    </p>
    <h3>
        2. Meditate
    </h3>
    <p>
        Meditation can provide you with a feeling of peace, harmony, and quietness.
        This process can help both your general wellbeing. You may use the
        mediation to relax and focus all the activity on fighting the stress. Not
        just that but being an expert on this technique can help you stay focused
        and keeping your inner peace. This means that, like sports, the benefits
        don’t end once you stop meditating, but in upcoming stressful environments
        and situations too.
    </p>
    <h3>
        3. Cook some pasta
    </h3>
    <p>
        When it comes to stress, it is also known that some people like cooking to
        disconnect from the world. Apart from that
    </p>
    <p>
        Eating complex carbohydrates may be not the best idea if you are trying to
        lose weight and cut additional calories. However, if you are stressed, why
        not having your favorite recipe of Your favorite Rigatoni Bolognese or
        spaghetti amatriciana after a nice workout session? It’s been
        scientifically proved that eating pasta can increase the serotonin levels,
        which amongst many tasks, it helps regulate anxiety, mood, and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, you should not abuse of too many carbs. When it comes to
        food, it must be important to say that ultra-processed food and sugar will
        have a negative impact. Therefore, it is also good to keep our diet as
        healthy as possible. It has a big impact in both our body and mental
        health.
    </p>
    <h3>
        4. Dress <strike>up</strike> down
    </h3>
    <p>
        Nature is not something in the environment, but it’s something that we can
        carry with ourselves. That’s why it’s important to choose the correct
        clothes when starting the day. For example, if you want to reduce
        eagerness, the best way after having your morning shower is selecting
        carefully natural clothes (linen, cotton, etc.) that will create a relaxed
        outfit. If you are stressed, dressing up with tight and elegant clothes may
        not be the best choice. Having a comfier garment on you will help you have
        a more easygoing lifestyle.
    </p>
    <h3>
        5. Explore nature
    </h3>
    <p>
        It’s said that people on villages are much happier than those living in big
        cities with all the traffic, pollution, and noise. It may be easier for
        some and more difficult for other. Nonetheless, one suggestion for those
        living in big cities is to try to escape for some days or do some
        excursions to the beach, lakes, or mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
        Especially these ones may be the best choice because researchers have
        proved that since air in high altitude is charged with negative ions (atoms
        that have lost electrons), these molecules help hikers relax and forget
        about their problems.
    </p>
    <h3>
        6. Sleep, Sleep &amp; Repeat
    </h3>
    <p>
        The function of sleeping has many processes behind that helps repair our
        brain and bodies. We all would like to have more time and we often tend to
        sacrifice our sleeping time in order to get many more things done in the
        day. However, with this are generating debt that we will pay the days
        after.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sleeping does not just make sure that we are more productive the day after,
        but it helps our whole body to recover and handle the stress accordingly
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s a vicious circle. Stress leads to insomnia and insomnia leads to more
        stress.
    </p>
    <h3>
        7. Switch it off
    </h3>
    <p>
        Having multiple devices with thousands of notifications per day is not the
        best way to stay focused and in good mood. Apart from the constant
        distractions, some of these messages and pop ups will create negative
        feelings (war, crisis, hunger, etc.) and increase the level of stress
        inside our bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
        For that reason, it is a good idea to keep the number of apps in our phone
        as reduced as possible and have some focus times defined in our day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another piece of advice is that once the workday or week are over, just
        toggle off the mailbox from your phone and hide the work laptop somewhere
        else. Even if it would seem that the world will collapse if you do so, try
        also to minimize the usage of your mobile phone to just those moments that
        really required.
    </p>
    <h3>
        8. Coffee
    </h3>
    <p>
        This one may be very obvious, but once we get into this habit is not easy
        to stop. We have discussed what the negative consequences of not sleeping
        are. The day after we need some energy, and the most accessible drug is a
        coffee shot. Since it seems to wake us up, we try one after another and
        some minutes later we are active, but our stress levels have also gone
        quite up. Cutting drastically coffee may be suicidal for some people.
        Therefore, a better idea may be to cut it progressively and replace it for
        healthier drinks such as green, matcha, black, and red tea. These infusions
        have great benefits when it comes to sleep quality, anxiety, and management
        of hormones
    </p>
    <h3>
        9. Eat more fruit
    </h3>
    <p>
        Either in solid state or in form of shakes and juices, fruit is very
        important and has a big impact on our bodies. Not just in our bodies or
        diet, fruits contain big amounts of different vitamins – for instance C and
        D-, that help us surpassing the stress threshold level. Therefore, these
        products can be a good booster to our anti-stress protection.
    </p>
    <p>
        If for some reason, you think you will not reach the needed vitamin levels,
        having some supplements will also help us achieve our goals.
    </p>
    <h3>
        10. Breathing Exercises
    </h3>
    <p>
        This one can be a technique that is used just when we are about to blow up or collapse.
        The trick in those tense situations is to handle our breathing in a good,
        consistent way with an efficient technique.
    </p>
    <p>
        You need to be as comfortable as you can and try to evade your mind and
        focus just on controlling your breathing. For example, put attention to the
        effect of inspiring through the nose and expiring through the moth.
        Counting the process will also help if you want to focus just on this
        activity as much as you can.
    </p>
    <h3>
        11. Spend time with animals
    </h3>
    <p>
        As with nature, spending time with animals will let us avoid our current
        work and responsibilities, with a more easygoing approach to life. The make
        us more aware of what the important aspects of life are.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, it has been confirmed that being in contact with animals such
        as dogs or cats activate the oxytocin hormone, which regulates the stress
        and comfort.
    </p>
    <h3>
        12. Read a novel
    </h3>
    <p>
        When there are many topics going through your mind, what I do is just
        trying to disconnect and focusing on only single topic. The easiest way to
        do so is taking the favorite book from the shelf or your book eReader.
        Although it is said that music may be a better way to disconnect it has
        been demonstrated with multiple researchs that reading a science or
        adventure story helps us totally disconnect from our daily tasks immersing
        ourselves in the story. In any case, you can leave the music for your HIIT
        session.
    </p>
    <h3>
        13. Switch on the PS4
    </h3>
    <p>
        In the case a book is not enough for you to evade the reality and manage
        the anxiety, a more active solution would be going to your computer or vide
        console and playing an adventure or any other type of game.
    </p>
    <p>
        As it occurs when reading, videogames help us distract ourselves with the
        preferred games. Videogames are engaging, fun and at the same time they are
        somehow challenging, getting some rewards. At the same time, as eating
        pasta, they increase our serotonin levels, having a positive impact on our
        well-being and mood.
    </p>
    <h3>
        14. Massage session
    </h3>
    <p>
        Massages can be a great complement to an exercise and apart from the
        muscular regeneration benefits, they also have benefits when it comes to
        anti-stress techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
        They help reduce the heart rate, blood pressure and overall improving our
        sleep quality and mental health, giving a boost to our well-being. Having
        just a 15–30-minute session can be a shot of good emotions and feelings.
    </p>
    <h3>
        15. Clean your body
    </h3>
    <p>
        To conclude the list, cleaning your body and face might me a good activity
        to increase our mood and relaxation levels. You may start exfoliating your
        face, continuing with a long bath with bath salts and candles and putting a
        face or ice will probably the best idea after a stressful working day.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the whole process you will leave the bathroom totally rejuvenated –
        and not just for your skin -.

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    If you have been in the crypto or blockchain scene for some time, you may
    be familiar with the different layers of the blockchain, their functions,
    and how they interact one with another. However, if you are new, you may
    hear terms such as L1 or L2 and you may ask yourself what these words are.
    Don’t worry about this.
</div>
<p>
    In this article we explain not just the different layers but also the
    importance of each of it. It’s also important to note what they mean and
    why some tokens may be correlated because they are part of the same layer.
</p>
<p>
    As it occurs with the OSI and the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) models, we
    also have different layers in blockchains.
    The different OSI layers are: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport,
    Session, Presentation, and Application.
    The ones of the Interest Protocol are just 4: Link, Internet, Transport,
    Application. A similar structure occurs in the Blockchains.
</p>
<p>
    We can distinguish 4 different Blockchain layers, where each one has a
    specific purpose. Each layer is essential and has some defined functions
    and roles. They start with Layer 0 and the last one is Layer 3. In order to
    see the different features, it’s better to see this with some examples.
</p>
<h2>
    Layer 0
</h2>
<p>
    This protocol is where everything starts and the bottom of the different
    blockchain protocols that we see later. It’s like the foundations of the
    building where the different infrastructure, hardware and internet are
    provided. Although, the other layers would be useless without this initial
    layer, it’s also the layer that cannot be seen and sometimes ignored.
</p>
<p>
    They allow interconnectivity and integration between traditional and
    blockchain network.
</p>
<p>
    As mentioned, this is where everything starts. Therefore, they allow other
    blockchains be built upon them and also that different blockchains are
    operable between them. In other words, the chains that are created on the
    layers above are interoperable and compatible thanks to the L0 protocols.
</p>
<p>
    For these characteristics they can be seen as the data transfer layer of
    the OSI model. Without this one, Bitcoin or Ethereum would not be able to
    run. Basically, their objective is to interconnect different chains between
    L1 protocols.

            <h5>L0 Example</h5>
            <h5>PolkaDot: Web3.0 Interoperability</h5>
            <small> The most famous example is probably PolkaDot. The goal of the protocol is
                like the one of a bridge between different L1 blockchains. It allows cross-blockchain transfers of any sort of data or asset, not just
                tokens. Connecting to Polkadot offers users  the potential to interoperate
                with a wide form of blockchains in the Polkadot network.<br>

<h2>
    Layer 1
</h2>
<p>
    Layer 1 blockchains are probably the most famous ones for most of us. They
    are also known as public chains because they have their own structure,
    encryption, algorithms, technology and mechanisms. These are blockchains
    that are used to process transactions on their own blockchain and have
    different utilities.
</p>
<p>
    This protocol consists of the following sublayers: Data layer, Network
    layer, Consensus layer and Activating layer
</p>
<p>
    Since the transactions need to be processed and validated, the famous
    Consensus Mechanism (PoW, PoS, etc.) is also inherent to this layer.
    However, there are also other technical aspects involved such as the block
    time, the different rules and the dispute resolution. In this layer, we
    also see different limitations such as scaling.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="/img/posts/blockchain_layers/algorand.png"  alt="Sustainable and scalable">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Algorand is probably one of the most sustainable blockchain due to the technology and consensus mechanism</span>
</p>
<p>
    The goal of Layer 1 blockchains is to achieve the following 3
    characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Decentralization
    </li>
    <li>
        Security
    </li>
    <li>
        Scalability
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There is a famous term called the Blockchain Trilemma, which says basically
    that basic chains can just achieve 2 out of 3.
</p>
<p>
    In order to achieve the first 2, scalability is sacrificed and left for
    later. It’s here where Layer 2 plays a key role too.
</p>
<p>
    Probably these blockchains are the most famous ones to you. Bitcoin,
    Ethereum, Cardano or Solana are examples of this category and most
    probably.

            <h5>L1 Example</h5>
            <h5>Algorand: Offsetting the Carbon Footprint</h5>
            <small> As opposed to Ethereum, Algorand is a L1 chain, without needing L2
                protocols for scability purposes. This is because the consensus mechanism
                in the Algorand Network is quite different. In this case, a group of
                validators is selected randomly each time, without needing to have the
                majority. Algorand is also known as the Green Blockchain.<br>

<h2>
    Layer 2
</h2>
<p>
    In L1 blockchains, we have seen the Blockchain Trilemma and the problem
    with scalability. Apart from the Blockchain Trilemma Bitcoin and Ethereum
    are getting older and what was valid some years ago it is no longer enough,
    mainly with the increasing number of users. .For example, we have several
    problems in terms of scalability, speed and gas fees. For that reason, the
    purpose of L2 blockchains is to enhance the L1 blockchains, with several
    updates and applications. Via this layer, the processing of the different
    transactions is also increased. This layer is seen as an auxiliary
    extension of the L1 protocol .
</p>
<p>
    For example, Ethereum is only able to process around 10 transactions per
    second. Ethereum is famous for many benefits, but one of the disadvantages
    is the gas fees. When the network is congested, there is a lot of
    competition to process the different transactions and it’s when the gas
    fees considerably increase – the law of supply and demand -. This problem
    is becoming more often because of the adoption of Ethereum and the
    applications within the ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
    What the L2 protocol does is to free up Ethereum (L1) from this work. This
    way, they can process thousands of transactions per second. Ethereum is the
    layer with more L2 protocols.
</p>
<p>
    Ethereum is famous for having many L2 solutions, but it also applies to
    other L1 layers such as Bitcoin.There are some examples for Etherum:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Polygon is one example running on top of Ethereum. The goal of the
        Indian platform is to connect blockchains built on Ethereum.
    </li>
    <li>
        Optimism is also developed for Ethereum in order to improve speed and
        reduce fees in the Ethereum network
    </li>
    <li>
        Immutable X is the second layer protocol used in the NFT Marketplace
        OpenSea (built on ERC-721), that helps also reduce fees when
        transacting in the blockchain.
    </li>
</ul>

            <h5>Lightning Network</h5>
            <small>For the most famous chain, the Lightning Network is a L2 payment protocol layered on top
                of Bitcoin. It permits fast transactions among participating nodes and has
                been proposed as an approach to the bitcoin scalability trouble.<br>

<h2>
    Layer 3
</h2>
<p>
    We have seen that L1 and L2 layers are quite linked to each one, but there
    are many differences between the different blockchains in these layers. The
    reason is that they use completely different technologies and processes.
    The purpose of the third layer is to abstract these differences and make
    the things much easier for the user. With this, the different ecosystems
    are interconnectable and can communicate regardless of the technical
    differences that we can find among them
</p>
<p>
    This is something similar to what’s done in the IP Internet Protocol and
    the application layer. L3 is the protocol that hosts the DApps. These
    applications are related to diverse topics such as DeFi, games, or storage
    apps.
</p>
<p>
    Although Bitcoin is the most known one here, Ethereum is the one that has
    more applications and has a huge ecosystem. The different cases vary across
    sectors:
</p>
<p>
    Ethereum aside, Solana is also famous for having many consolidated
    applications.
</p>
<p>
<h3>
    Examples of dApps
</h3>
<p>
In order to understand the last layer, these are some examples of complete different applications accessible to users.
</p>
</p>
<h4>
    Uniswap (v2 and v3)
</h4>
<p>
    <a href="https://uniswap.org/">
        Uniswap</a> is one of the largest DEXs in the space and is powered by the Ethereum
    blockchain. One of the main differences compared to Binance or Coinbase is
    that Uniswap operates without an order book. Instead, it uses framework to
    provide trading liquidity.
</p>
<h4>
    OpenSea
</h4>
<p>
    <a href="https://opensea.io/">
        OpenSea</a> is the world’s largest Non-Fungible Token marketplace which is
    based on Ethereum ERC-721.

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    You have been probably hearing the term DAO for some time, but some topics may
    not be clear yet to you. A DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous
    Organization. In other words, it is an organization that is controlled
    by algorithms or smart contracts, it is not bound by any particular law
    since it is controlled by a blockchain and smart contracts. In other
    words, what it is looking for is to get rid of intermediaries, just as
    bitcoin did when it was created more than 10 years ago. The purpose of
    a DAO is also the one for a company or an institution to be able to
    function without hierarchical management.
</div>
<p>
    To give you an example, bitcoin can be considered a primitive DAO,
    since it works with a series of given rules, is autonomous, and is
    managed in a decentralized way following a consensus protocol.
    Although, the use of Smart contracts, typical of DAOs, did not reach
    the Ethereum platform, which allowed their creation, and has given them
    their current structure.
</p>
<p>
    Initially, Bitcoin was considered the first fully functional DAO, as it
    has a set of pre-programmed rules, works autonomously, and is
    coordinated through a distributed consensus protocol. Since then, the
    use of smart contracts and dApps has been made possible by the Ethereum
    platform, which has brought the creation of DAOs closer to the general
    public and shaped their current look.
</p>
<h2>
    How it works
</h2>
<p>
    The launch of development of a DAO is composed of 3 different steps easy to understand. This is how DAOs work and the distinct phases before it becomes totally decentralized.
</p>
<h3>
    First phase
</h3>
<p>
    The first phase is setting the rules according to which it will work.
    Those rules are codes as a smart contract, existing autonomously on the
    Internet, but at the same time requiring developers to perform some
    specific tasks.
</p>
<h3>
    Second phase
</h3>
<p>
    Once the rules are established, the next phase is the financing phase.
    This is a very important milestone part for two reasons. First of all,
    a DAO has to have some kind of internal property. In this case, these
    are tokens that can be spent by the organization or used to reward
    certain activities within it.
</p>
<p>
    Second, by investing in a DAO, users gain voting rights, as if they
    owned the shares of a company. Consequently, you can give your opinion
    and take part in the decisions of the DAO.
</p>
<h3>
    Third phase
</h3>
<p>
    Once the funding period ends and a DAO is deployed, it becomes a fully
    autonomous body and completely independent from its creators, as well
    as from anyone else. They are open-source, which means their code can
    be viewed by anyone. Also, all financial rules and transactions are
    recorded on the blockchain. This makes DAOs transparent, immutable, and
    incorruptible.
</p>
<p>
    Once the DAO is up and running, all decisions about where and how to
    spend your funds are made by consensus. Everyone who bought a stake in
    a DAO can make proposals about its future. To prevent the network from
    being spammed with proposals, a monetary deposit may be required to
    submit such a proposal.
</p>
<p>
    Subsequently, the interested parties vote on the proposal. To perform
    any action, the majority needs to agree to do it. The percentage
    required to reach that majority may vary depending on each DAO, as may
    be specified in its code.
</p>
<p>
    Essentially, DAOs allow people to exchange their funds with anyone in
    the world. This can be done in the form of an investment, a charitable
    donation, fundraisers, loans, etc. all without a middleman. One
    potentially important problem with the voting system is that even if a
    security hole was detected in early code, it cannot be fixed until the
    majority votes on it. While the vote is taking place, such hackers can
    exploit a bug in the code.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/dao/dao_types.jpg" alt="Diversity of DAOs">
    <span class="caption text-muted">There are diverse DAO categories and more and more DAOs created in those</span>
</p>
<h2>
    How to invest
</h2>
<p>
    Investing in a DAO is relatively easy, especially if we know have
    experience buying other cryptocurrencies and we already have a wallet
    to store the coins. All we really need to do is buy tokens of a
    particular DAO. As described before, buying tokens would be the
    equivalent of buying shares of Amazon, Apple, or Microsoft. In some
    cases, there are dedicated channels like Discord where some interesting
    information is shared.
</p>
<p>
    Once the financing phase is over, we will be able to make proposals,
    vote on them and even obtain benefits. The number of tokens purchased
    will correlate to the amount of voting power we will get within the
    DAO.
</p>
<p>
    However, before investing, we must be sure about the project to know
    exactly what we are getting into. DAOs are completely transparent and
    their underlying code is always open source, which means that only we
    have the opportunity to review the code to make sure there are no bugs
    in it.
</p>
<p>
    It is undeniable that the very concept of DAOs is extremely exciting as
    it strives to solve everything that is wrong with the way modern
    organizations are managed. A perfectly structured DAO gives each
    investor the opportunity to shape the organization. There is no
    hierarchical structure, which means that each innovative idea can be
    submitted by anyone and considered by the entire organization. With a
    set of pre-written rules that every investor knows before joining the
    organization, as well as the voting system, they leave no room for
    discussion.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, since both submitting a proposal and voting in favor of it
    require the investor to spend a certain amount of money, it pushes him
    to evaluate his decisions and not waste time on ineffective solutions.
    Finally, as all the rules, as well as each of the financial
    transactions, are registered in the Blockchain, available for review by
    anyone, the DAOs are completely transparent. Everyone who participates
    helps decide how to spend the funds and can track how those funds are
    spent.
</p>
<h2>
     Examples
</h2>
<p>
    Depending on the purpose, there are several types of DAOs. Some of them
    are the following ones:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Investment DAOs
    </li>
    <li>
        Collector DAOs
    </li>
    <li>
        Entertainment DAOs
    </li>
    <li>
        Grant DAOs
    </li>
    <li>
        Protocol DAOS
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In this article, we will focus on some names related to different DAO
    categories, with no preferential order.
</p>
<h3>
    1. Maker DAO
</h3>
<p>
    This is probably one of the most famous DAO out there. We have seen
    that with DeFi, we can reach the democratization of finance and we can
    make many products available to almost everyone around the world
</p>
<p>
    MakerDao, not to be confused with DAO Maker, has world’s first unbiased
    currency, Dai, which is a Maker Dao’s star product. DAI is a stable,
    decentralized currency that does not discriminate. Any individual or
    business can take benefit from the advantages of digital money.
</p>
<p>
    Dai is a stable coin, hence there is no volatility and for that reason,
    it is used in different financing projects. With this coin, you can
    exchange your assets for Dai and use this money in various aspects of
    finance.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding governance, a community of MKR token holders governs the
    Maker Protocol, the smart contracts that power the stable coin Dai.
</p>
<p>
    Over 400 apps and services such as wallets, DeFi platforms, or games
    have integrated Dai as an allowed payment method.

<h3>
    2. KlimaDAO
</h3>
<p>
    With the importance of climate change and small reactivity from some
    governments and companies, it is time that we do something about it.
    While our actions may not have had much positive impact in the past. we
    can start pushing for a change with KlimaDao
</p>
<p>
    With KlimaDAO, users can make a better more sustainable and greener
    world, by fighting against climate change. Via this mechanism, owners
    of this token can earn rewards with the KLIMA token. KLIMA is a digital
    currency backed by real carbon assets.
</p>
<p>
    They have started a decentralized and open market for carbon. Besides,
    the KLIMA token incentivizes investors, citizens, and organizations to
    participate in and govern this new economy.
</p>
<p>
    By increasing access and demand for carbon offsets, KlimaDAO makes
    pro-climate projects more profitable. At the same time, this process
    forces companies to adapt faster to climate change.

<h3>
    3. Olympus DAO
</h3>
<p>
    With all the central banks printing money and excessive Quantitative
    Easing, these actions have led to many negative consequences. For
    example, it has caused the devaluation of our currencies and assets in
    most countries.
</p>
<p>
    Olympus is building a community-owned, decentralized, and
    censorship-resistant reserve currency that is deeply liquid,
    asset-backed, and used widely. The name of this currency is OHM.
</p>
<p>
    With the rise of decentralized finance and economy, these concepts will
    also need a decentralized reserve currency. In other words, we need a
    currency that is not pegged to any central bank or fiat system
</p>
<p>
    Via this, Olympus DAO’s goal is to build a stable but independent
    currency that achieves purchasing power, broad acceptance, and high
    utility for all users.

</h2>
<p>
    Seed Club is a DAO whose mechanisms are similar to those of a modern
    incubator or accelerator, investing in start-ups. You can make an
    enormous impact when it comes to deciding what your favorite projects
    and start-ups are and finance those thanks to Seed Club
</p>
<p>
    They also state that their goal is to support and help projects for the
    long-term, and they are not looking for short-term wins.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, Seed Club is a DAO that builds and invests in communities
    investing in early projects. One of their focuses is on Web3
    communities. They have financed to date more than 30 projects and one
    of their flagship communities is included below.

<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    DAOs and crypto in general have brought different benefits to users.
    Some of them are access, costs, or transparency. We are happy about the
    fact that are more opportunities that focus on our goals and that via
    pooling individuals with the same objectives we can achieve our desired
    goal. At the same time, there is also criticism related to the level of
    experience the members may have. The comment is that as opposed to
    traditional organizations, where a specific number of experience people
    (e.g. board of directors) make the decisions, granting all members of a
    DAO the power to make any change may not be the best generating the
    best results for these autonomous organizations in the long-term.
</p>
<p>
    However, what is certain is that DAOs have created disruption and could
    shake in the long-term the current organization design and how the
    interactions within these.
</p>
<p>
    Although there has been an increase in the number of DAOs, we will see
    many more interesting in the next years. In case you would like to
    investigate further, please note that the code of these DAOs is
    accessible. Therefore, please analyze in deep the content and the data
    in order to detect any problem independent of the topic/goal of the
    chosen one.

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    If you are already up to date with concepts such as the ones of blockchain,
    DeFi, or metaverse, now is the time to find out about Web3. This term has
    gained traction in 2021 and 2022 and continues to be mentioned in articles
    that discuss about topics such NFTs, cryptocurrencies, or decentralized
    finance. However, Web3 (or Web 3.0) is far more than that as you will see
    below.
</div>
<p>
    On top of the latest trends and news, I see more ads, courses and job
    offers related to Web3. That is related to the growth and how the corporate
    world can benefit from this generation.
</p>
<p>
    Web3 is the third generation of Internet services for web site and
    applications. This concept focuses on the use of machine-based data
    understanding to provide a semantic and data-centric Web. The final goal of
    Web3 is to create smarter, more connected, and more open websites. Not just
    that, but the goal of Web3, as we will see later, is also to give back the
    prominence to the users.
</p>
<p>
    Web3 is not implemented yet, so there is no clear definition about various
    aspects yet. To give you an idea, making the transition from the original
    web, from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, took more than one decade. Nowadays, we are
    still working with Web 2.0 and there may be still years to come until we
    see the full capabilities of Web3.

<h2>
    History of the Internet
</h2>
<p>
    To give you some history about the internet, we can see that each topic for
    each of the Web version:
</p>
<h3>
    Web 1.0
</h3>
<p>
    If the early web, called 1.0, everything worked around hyperlinks. Web 1.0,
    also known as the World Wide Web, appeared first. Some of us will remember
    those days when connecting to the Internet was a still a slow process and
    there were still not many options yet.
</p>
<h3>
    Web 2.0
</h3>
<p>
    Next, we have Web2.0. This one was around social networks. This is the term you have been hearing in the last years with the boom of Facebook, Twitter and other companies.
</p>
<p>
    As more people began to use the Internet, the potential it had was
    understood globally. For this reason, new infrastructures were created to
    promote it. The Internet became faster and allowed for heavier applications
    and websites, which gave rise to the era of social networks and huge
    platforms such as Netflix, YouTube, Facebook, or Amazon.
</p>
<p>
    Today, people from all over the world can share information and be
    entertained, shop, find answers to their questions and interact with each
    other thanks to Web 2.0.
</p>
<h3>
    Web3
</h3>
<p>
    The last generation, Web 3.0, is based on tokens, the digital units of
    exchange for blockchain technologies.
</p>
<p>
    There are already some Web3 examples. On one hand, we have Apple's Siri,
    which
    <strong>
        uses voice recognition techniques and artificial intelligence to bring
        results and perform actions
    </strong>
    . To give us an idea of the improvement that this entails, Webs 1.0 and 2.0
    carry out word-by-word matches of the text in relation to what is published
    on the network. This often brings with it an information bias.
</p>
<p>
    Web3 systems, however, seek contextualized knowledge to help people in
    their searches, pointing to a series of analyses and potentially useful
    information. One of the distinctions of the Web 3.0 search engine is the
    time the user needs to spend navigating through a universe of data to find
    what they really want resolved.
</p>
<p>
    Companies like Amazon, Apple and IBM have been investing heavily in Web 3.0
    technologies. For example, Google Inc. over the last decade has made
    several acquisitions of companies in the Semantic Web area, such as Applied
    Semantics and Metaweb Technologies, Inc, among others.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, not everything will take so long to arrive to our daily
    lives. There are some technologies that will define this new web that are
    already being developed. For example, smart home and home automation
    applications using wireless networks and IoT are examples of how Web3 is
    already impacting technology.
</p>
<p>
    If we go to existing devices: Apple's Siri or Amazon’s Alexa are examples
    of Web3 since they combine artificial intelligence with voice recognition.
    This network is still developing and there is still a long way to go.
    Another important player in Web3 is the Brave Browser and some interesting
    reward mechanisms such as BAT tokens.

<h2>
    Characteristics of Web3
</h2>
<p>
    First, Web 3.0 will be primarily data centric. This data is endless and for
    that reason it is necessary to design an appropriate storage architecture
    and technology. Although Big Data seems to be the way to go, there is still
    research to be done on the most effective use of technology to store and
    manage this data, as privacy issues could arise in the future too.
</p>
<h4>
    Tokenization
</h4>
<p>
    This new web model has many services based on the token economy, so that
    the ownership and control of these services would be distributed among the
    owners of the tokens, who are also users. The tokens, as we know, have
    exchange value, so this means that users can collect these tokens whenever
    they want. Therefore, Web3 and DeFi may also come hand in hand.
</p>
<p>
    What it does seem is that Web 3.0 will be primarily data centric. This data
    is infinite and therefore it is necessary to design an appropriate storage
    architecture and technology. Although Big Data seems to be the way to go,
    there is still a lot of research to be done on the most effective use of
    technology to store data, as privacy issues could arise.
</p>
<h4>
    Robustness
</h4>
<p>
    This network will give creators and users more freedom in general. It will
    ensure that the latter always have control over their online data by using
    decentralized networks. The next version of the Internet is also expected
    to be more reliable given its decentralized nature, which eliminates the
    possibility of a single point of failure
</p>
<h4>
    Democratization
</h4>
<p>
    It does not need to be controlled by a single entity. The largest companies
    may no longer have full control over the Internet. As a result,
    decentralized applications or apps cannot be censored or restricted in any
    way.
</p>
<p>
    What is going on now with Web 2.0 is that users create but it is the
    technology companies that monetize this content
</p>
<h4>
    Customization
</h4>
<p>
    We will also be able to personalize our browsing experience because this
    type of website will be able to understand our preferences and tastes. This
    will also allow us to navigate more productively, focusing on what we are
    really interested in.
</p>
<h4>
    Commerce
</h4>
<p>
    The same way Web3 will help users, this version will also help businesses,
    and this will cause eCommerce to continue growing. Sellers will better
    understand our purchasing needs and will show us those products and
    services that we are interested in buying with the help of artificial
    intelligence. This will allow us to see better, more relevant ads that are
    more likely to be beneficial to us.
</p>
<h4>
    Better connectivity
</h4>
<p>
    In the past years, we have seen cases that because of interruptions in the
    service, we have lost access to some sites or services for hours.
</p>
<p>
    Since the data will be stored in distributed databases by decentralization,
    users will not have to worry about service interruptions or account
    suspensions for technical reasons.
</p>
<h4>
    Decentralization
</h4>
<p>
    As we have commented in the previous point, one of the key characteristics
    of web 3.0 is decentralization. In this new version, the data will be
    connected in a decentralized way, unlike 2.0, in which it is mainly stored
    in centralized places. Therefore, the data will not be kept in the
    datacentres of big corporations anymore.
</p>
<p>
    We saw with the explosion of web 2.0 brings social networks and
    interactivity with the user, which creates most of its content. It is the
    era of companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, creating silo,
    centralized services dependent on these corporations.
</p>
<h2>
    The role of corporations
</h2>
<p>
    The impact of Web 3.0 on companies will take place in different ways. In
    some cases,    <strong>it will make them highly user-centric and more transparent</strong>
    . Everything that was wrong in terms of user data will undergo a radical
    transformation.
</p>
<p>
    Traditional and new businesses alike will welcome Blockchain technology and
    all the possibilities it brings. You will see that your applications will
    receive blockchain updates in which everything will be made public and
    accessible.
</p>
<p>
    Web 3.0 will bring about a major change in how the Internet works by
    focusing on user privacy. In fact, this is a problem that has been
    discussed for a long time but has not been effectively solved.
</p>
<p>
    Web3 uses blockchain technology, unlike Web 2.0, which takes advantage of
    the Internet to develop applications. It is technically safer to store
    customer data on a blockchain as it is decentralized and its use by
    businesses is transparent, thus protecting it from hackers. Some experts
    say the transfer of data ownership to consumers could disrupt the
    technology sector. And this is because many technology companies would lose
    access to the data that has given them a competitive advantage until now.
</p>
<p>
    Also, thanks to blockchain technology, visitors to a website will have a
    more pleasant login experience. Think how many times you have logged into
    websites using your Facebook profile. Blockchain technology employs the
    same principle as Facebook, which already owns the user's information.
    However,
    <strong>
        by using Blockchain, you will be the sole owner of your information.
    </strong>

<h2>
    What's next?
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>To sump up, in Web</strong>
    <strong>3</strong>
    <strong>
        , users will also be able to interact with data thanks to the use of
        artificial intelligence and machine learning technology.
    </strong>
    That is, it will combine the concepts of the Semantic Web with AI.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, the use of artificial intelligence will allow data much
    faster to users and that these data will be more relevant and personified.
    We are starting to see the use of this technology on the Internet
    <strong>
        through algorithms that are used to suggest products or videos to users
        based on their previous searches
    </strong>
    .
</p>
<p>
    However, this will be even more advanced, and we have still to see a wide
    range of new possibilities in the upcoming years.
</p>
<p>
    We could say that with Web3 we come back to where the Internet started and
    the original idea: a decentralized internet, where there is no control from
    central authorities and the power is given back to the users and consumers.
    However, the full potential of Web3 is still to be seen.

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    Some weeks ago, we introduced some investment funds or ETFs focusing on
    specific countries or indexes such as the S&amp;P500 or the Nasdaq. We also
    went further and analyzed some interesting regions with a considerable
    expected growth for the following years.
</div>
<p>
    I have also said that I prefer to focus on these broad investment vehicles
    in order to get the best possible returns with the lowest possible risk,
    due to the diversification that these products offer.
</p>
<p>
    However, this approach may be boring, and we can always allocate some of
    our savings to have some fun, either in the way of cherry picking some
    stocks or in this case with some niche sectors. The idea on selecting these
    specific areas for the ETF, is because we think that there will be a huge
    growth in these sectors in the upcoming years (or in the short-term).
    Depending on our strategy, they help us combine our defensive and
    aggressive options in our portfolio.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the price of a security is composed of the current
    earnings and the estimated growth. This also means that for sectors with a
    high growth, the current price already reflects it.
</p>
<p>
    In any case, these are some of the industries that will create a
    considerable impact in the years to come, and for that reason it may be
    worth to have some of our portfolio destined to any of these sectors.
</p>
<h2>
    1. Videogames
</h2>
<p>
    When I was young, the video games sector was already important, but it was
    below the movies or the music industry. Today, this industry’s revenue is
    bigger than the one of these two industries combined. The growth has been
    incredible in the last 15 years, but it will for sure not stop there.
</p>
<p>
    While some years ago, most games could not be played online, this activity
    has also changed in the last years, opening new possibilities. For example,
    we have also seen this with the different organizations supporting and
    investing in eSports. New ways of entertainment have been included, giving
    more importance to social or mobile games.
</p>
<p>
    The latest trends such as NFT or the metaverse have also an important role
    on some of these games and the different unique items that the players may
    get. In some cases, the trends could change completely the way we game.
    Therefore, if the growth in the last decade was already impressive, these
    two blockchain phenomenon will help to push the videogames even further.

    <h2>
        2. Artificial Intelligence
    </h2>
    <p>
        The advance of Artificial Intelligence is unstoppable, as organizations
        are adopting different branches of this technology to boost their
        digital transformation, giving great strength to a market that
        encompasses AI software, hardware, and services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, the application fields of AI range from finance to robot
        control, from image recognition to vehicle driving and much more. We
        can see that big players like Google, Apple, Intel, Amazon, IBM are
        investing massively in the development of this sector. Not long ago,
        Google bough the company DeepMind for $400 million.
    </p>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that seeks
        to bring technology to mimic human behavior. Theorizing of a computer
        mind that mimics the functioning of the human goes back more than half
        a century, in 1956, when the term Artificial Intelligence was
        introduced as part of the Dartmouth Summer Research project.
    </p>
    <p>
        The shift from theory to practice came hand in hand with the rise of
        computer skills. The technological acceleration of recent years has
        allowed the development of increasingly sophisticated and powerful
        algorithms. Today, the application fields of AI range from finance to
        robot control, from image recognition to vehicle driving and much more.
        Big conglomerates like Google, Apple, Intel, Amazon, IBM are investing
        massively in the development of this sector.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to some sources, sales in the next eight years may grow by up
        to 35,570 million dollars, or what is the same, an increase capacity of
        more than 600%. In addition to this astonishing information, investment
        in AI is increasing at a rate of 37% per year and by 2022 it will
        exceed 77 billion dollars, three times more than the current 24
        billion.

        3. eCommerce
    </h2>
    <p>
        Although eCommerce had been growing steadily for years, COVID-19 was
        the trigger that changed in many cases how we buy different products
        and articles, and in general the shopping experience. Due to the loosen
        restrictions in most countries, the growth has been normalized in 2021,
        but predictions say that eCommerce will be growing every year. Indeed,
        the pandemic helped some people discover that buying could be much
        easier and without any issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some factors helping the growth will be related to mobile phones and
        faster technologies such as 5G. More services such as augmented
        reality, virtual reality, image recognition or artificial intelligence
        will be possible to offer a broader range of possibilities to the
        customer. Besides, almost every company today has an online application
        and from there the user can buy directly almost anything.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, the rise of more payment options such as of
        cryptocurrencies will also be an added benefit to customers wanting to
        buy online.
    </p>
    <p>
        While more senior people were initially reluctant to online shopping,
        younger generations such as the millennials are the early adaptors of
        this trend. This means that this way of buying will be already
        inculcated for the new generations to come and will be seen as
        something completely normal in the everyday life of every customer in a
        few years from now.

    <h2>
        4. Cannabis
    </h2>
    <p>
        This is a controversial topic in some cases, but the truth is that more
        and more countries are allowing the usage of marijuana for therapeutic
        treatments. I have said that it is a polemic aspect because Cannabis
        has been seen as a criminal or something that should be avoided until
        recently. Although, we need more education on this topic, mainly for
        younger generations. it has been proved that the Marijuana derivative
        medicaments or therapies have multiples benefits in diseases.
        Furthermore, the price of this medication is generally lower compared
        to other alternatives, and it also has less side effects.
    </p>
    <p>
        The US and Canada have been two of the latest countries that have
        approved the usage of Marijuana, and as many things occur, some other
        regions such as Europe or Asia may also follow soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is expected to grow between 2022 and 2030 with an annualized rate of
        25%. Apart from the medical advances, the decriminalization has also an
        important role in this rise.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two factors that will be key for the expansion of the
        Cannabis sector:
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of regulation, it is predicted that more and more countries
        will allow medical treatment with Marijuana or derivatives from this
        drug.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another key aspect is the global population aging. We live more years,
        and because of this, we also suffer from more diseases. In some cases,
        Marijuana can play an important role to mitigate of our life
        expectancy. All in all, Cannabis has the potential to help humankind,
        being part of the different breakthroughs in terms of health.

        5. Water
    </h2>
    <p>
        Because all these investments don’t have to be necessarily related to
        technological improvements, we refer in this section to one of the
        oldest things in history. We are made for the most part out of water
        and we need water to survive. While people think on electricity or gas
        when investing in different companies, we could survive without these
        two, but water is essential for our survival. Other utilities such as
        oil and gold are also
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately. due to climatic change and other linked problems, water
        is becoming scarcer. Besides, accessing to water in some countries is
        still a nightmare. Out of the total water on earth, 97% is saltwater.,
        and out of the remaining 3%, another percentage is frozen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since we all need water and there is less for all of us, with the
        expected growth of the global population, the more demand and less
        supply means that the value of water will increase.

        Conclusion

    <p>
        We have described 5 sector that are expected to grow in the years to
        come at cruise speed. Investing in companies that are focused on these
        sectors can add additional diversification to our portfolio, add
        defensive or aggressive variants to it while we have some fun with our
        choice.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are other sectors that were not included in this post, but that
        will grow very much in the next decade. Some of them are the following
        ones: Blockchain, semiconductors or metaverse
    </p>
    <p>
        As mentioned in the introduction, even if they are expected to grow,
        the current price may already reflect the expected expansion and
        development of these industries.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another factor to be noted is liquidity. For example, if you want to
        buy or sell, there may be less options, not just in the form of funds
        or ETFs, but in the number of orders.
    </p>
    <p>
        All in all, there are some advantages and disadvantages when selecting
        niche funds. Therefore, I would not recommend including 100% of your
        portfolio into niche sectors. On the other hand, allocating just some
        of the money into these funds could be a wise and fun option for the
        future.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested on how to access to buy them, an example of
        different funds and ETFs has been included. You can see a list of
        brokers in one of my past articles:

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    In previous posts, we have explained different alternatives for our
    investments, and related to this one, we have also explained some ones
    focused on crypto or DeFi. The Algorand Foundation is another way to
    diversify your portfolio at the same time you take part in the decisions of
    the Algorand ecosystem. Connected to this, the Algorand Governance second
    period ended some days ago (31 March) and the third period just started
    some days ago
</div>
<p>
    But, what’s Algorand, and what is this Governance? For several people, these
    terms may be completely unknown.
</p>
<p>
    The history of Algorand begins in the year 2017, when the company was
    created by Silvio Micali, a well-known MIT professor, Turing award winner,
    and specialist in cryptography. Micali, who has been part of the crypto
    community since 1980, has significant work in asymmetric cryptography to
    his credit, and is a co-creator with Shafirira Goldwasser of zero-knowledge
    proofs (ZKP).
</p>
<p>
    Micali, who has always been a researcher, knows about blockchain technology
    and Bitcoin in 2015, and is interested in it. At that point, Micali started
    working on his personal cryptocurrency project, he decided to improve the
    specifications of Bitcoin and Ethereum. This led him to associate with
    Nickolai Zeldavich, a colleague from MIT and who served as Head of
    Distributed Systems at this institution, and who participated in the
    Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).
</p>
<p>
    It is how Algorand was created. Algorand's main objective is to become a
    platform dedicated to offering high-speed decentralized applications
    (DApps) and DeFi that are available to everyone. To achieve this, Algorand
    is a permissionless blockchain. In this way, anyone can be part of it,
    within a transparent system in which everyone can achieve success through
    decentralized projects and applications.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, to deal with the Blockchain Trilemma, Algorand is based
    on a powerful and fast consensus protocol that can be used by any user with
    minimal computational power, who owns $ALGO and is online. All of these
    elements give you the right to be chosen to participate in Algorand's block
    consensus, which is a derivative of the Proof of Stake system.
</p>
<p>
    But along with this, Algorand focuses its development on creating tools
    that facilitate the deployment of decentralized applications and all the
    infrastructure necessary for their operation.
</p>
<h3>
    How does Algorand work?
</h3>
<p>
    As we discussed a moment ago, Algorand is a permissionless blockchain and
    network. This first point is vital to eliminate any type of barrier in the
    use and evolution of the protocol. The main idea behind this principle is
    to guarantee a high level of decentralization, scalability and security.
</p>
<p>
    Second, Algorand's operation is based on a consensus protocol derived from
    Proof of Stake (called Pure Proof of Stake - PPoS). This system is created
    in order to guarantee the full participation of those who are part of the
    network, providing protection and speed. The use of PPoS is framed in
    achieving block production speed measured in a few seconds, which would
    allow a high scalability of the network, thus serving thousands of users
    concurrently, with truly short waiting times and, above all, with very low
    commission costs.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, the Algorand development team has devised new consensus
    algorithms, Byzantine fault-tolerant systems, and an entirely new hashing
    and digital signature system, with a focus on enabling the greatest
    possible scalability.
</p>
<h3>
    Pure Proof of Stake
</h3>
<p>
    The main pillar of Algorand's scalability and speed is its Pure Proof of
    Stake or Proof of Pure Participation (PPoS) protocol. This protocol is a
    derivative of the well-known Proof of Stake (PoS) of other cryptocurrencies
    such as the upcoming Ethereum Merge. The idea of this protocol in Algorand
    is to allow a sufficiently secure resistance to Byzantine faults, while
    providing great speed in the generation and validation of blocks within the
    network. At the same time, PoS is capable of supporting a large number of
    concurrent users and scales well as the network increases in number of
    validators.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/algorand/gov.jpg" alt="Governance Period 3">
    <span class="caption text-muted">The main dates for the third Governance period are included above</span>
</p>
<h3>
    Algorand Governance
</h3>
<p>
    Before introducing the Governance period, we have described how Algorand
    works and the different benefits. Furthermore, the purpose of the
    organization is that everyone has a voice in the future plans of the
    network. The Algorand Governance first period started on 1 October 2021 and
    each of these periods last 3 months.
</p>
<p>
    This is done with a term called “Governor.” Governors are responsible for
    the most important economic and political decisions. This is be done
    through regular public votes that the Algorand Foundation will responsibly
    execute for the benefit of the broader ecosystem, based on the decisions of
    these Governors.
</p>
<p>
    It must be noted that Algorand holders are not automatically enrolled in
    the community governance. Algos holders need to go to the governance web
    portal and specify how many Algo tokens they are going to commit in each
    governance period. To participate, governors must sign a transaction
    representing the amount of tokens invested. The governance web portal can
    be used to generate a transaction in the correct format
</p>
<p>
    For keeping your ALGO, you can use your Ledger, Pera Algo, AlgoSigner or My
    Algo wallet. It must be noted that in order to be eligible for the rewards
    paid at the end of the quarter, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The number of ALGO committed for the period cannot decrease
    </li>
    <li>
        You must vote in the voting session for the respective period
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>
    Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
    Via this mechanism, the main objectives of the Governance periods are the
    following:
</p>
<p>
    On one hand, in this period the owners of ALGO who have committed can
    decide on the future steps of the Algorand network and any improvements
    that can be done via voting.
</p>
<p>
    On another hand, by committing the ALGO tokens, the owners are rewarded.
    There are generally 70.5 Billion algos for rewards. These need to be
    distributed between all the committed ALGO. On average, in the recent
    periods the return rate is around 10% per year, which is around 2.5% per
    quarter.
</p>
<p>
    The more total ALGOs are committed, the lower the APY will be. However, the
    main goal of this governance periods is also to make of the Algorand
    ecosystem the future of finance.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, we can also see recent new projects such as AlgoFi that will
    also play a key role in the growth and adoption of Algorand.

    Introduction
</h2>
<<div class="text-article">>
    It’s said that eyes are the soul's reflection and they are totally right.
    Our look can say man things about how we feel, our emotions and our energy.
</div>
<p>
    Nobody can’t disagree to this statement, but then, why we don’t pay
    attention to these two organs and the muscles around them? The technology
    has brought many advantages to our lifestyle. However, With our time
    exposed to screens and different devices, our eyes are suffering much more
    compared to other times in history
</p>
<h2>
    The importance of the eyes
</h2>
<p>
    Think for a moment about your eyes. You use them all the time when
    you're awake. You blink (between 11,000 and 15,000 times a day), you wink,
    you squint when you see the price of the new phone or clothes, you rub them
    when you're tired, etc. All in all, you use them for almost everything.
    These actions occur thanks to the number of tiny muscles that surround our
    eyes.
</p>
<p>
    Around our eyes, There are 22 muscles. called periorbital muscles and these
    muscles allow you to enjoy a wide range of gestures and movements. Besides,
    they have some characteristics that make them peculiar and, above all, they
    are clear indicators of how we feel. For example: when you sleep too
    little, don't drink enough water, your diet is not the best one, you are
    tired or sad, you abuse alcohol or any other substances... the eye contour
    is the first part of our body that shows this problem to the world.
</p>
<h2>
    Sensitive Organs
</h2>
<p>
    The skin around your eyes is the thinnest skin on your face. It is five
    times thinner than the rest of your face, and ten times thinner than that
    of other parts of the body. That means it has hardly any sebaceous glands
    and no supporting tissue, which is basically collagen. Therefore, it droops
    sooner.
</p>
<p>
    This causes this area to break down more quickly, leading to wrinkles known
    as crow's feet, and eyelid sagging.
</p>
<h2>
    The impact of sun
</h2>
<p>
    We have just described that the part of the eyes is very sensitive since it
    is a very thin skin. Therefore, it has fewer layers underneath and, exposed
    to Ultraviolet rays. This results in what is known as hyperpigmentation.
    Another cause of this unfortunate coloration is genetics; there are simply
    people who naturally have more dark circles under their eyes than others.
</p>
<p>
    Although fluid retention occurs to women in other parts of the body, in men
    this problem occurs in the eyes are. That’s when appear the feared dreaded
    bags as we get older.
</p>
<p>
    Aging is another critical factor for us. When you are young, the membrane
    is responsible for retaining the fat in the eyelids. But when we gain
    weight or older, the eyes membrane gets thinner and loses strength over
    time,
</p>
<h2>
    How to protect them?
</h2>
<p>
    All in all, we can say that the skin around the eye contour is the thinnest
    in the human body, it has a small number of sebaceous glands and its blood
    microcirculation is very slow. As a result, it is fragile, dehydrates
    easily and accumulates toxins quickly. In addition, and due to constant
    muscle contractions, it is the first area where signs of fatigue or aging
    become visible.
</p>
<p>
    We have seen the different problems men have when it comes to eyes and the
    areas surrounding it. Since it is a very sensitive area, we are exposed to
    the sun, and high-resolution screens, we need to find some ways to protect
    and repair the damage.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, a good diet, sleeping at least 8 hours or drinking enough water
    are of the utmost importance. However, without recurring to cosmetic
    surgery, there are some products that can be our allies to mitigate these
    problems.

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    The world of crypto assets or cryptocurrencies is an ever-changing process
    that, like many others, is looking for the next big trend to continue
    generating digital and real value. This new trend could be Staking, the
    method that rewards users based on the number of coins they back the
    blockchain with. Staking comes from the Proof-Of-Stake, the consensus
    mechanism used in some of the crypto currency networks. Through
    proof-to-stake, some investors are already earning quite considerable
    annual percentage return while generating substantial passive income
    without efforts.
</div>
<h2>
    PoW vs PoS
</h2>
<p>
    Currently, both bitcoin and ether rely on miners to complete complex
    puzzles to validate transactions and create new coins. This process is
    known as proof-of-work (PoW) and requires an enormous amount of energy,
    having negative consequences in the environment. The reason is that for
    this validation process, the PoW consumes a high number of fossil fuels.
    Other cryptos, such as Solana or Algorand, already operate with
    proof-of-stake (PoS), with also quite reasonable returns.
</p>
<p>
    Specifically, the PoS process allows users to validate transactions based
    on the number of coins they contribute or wager. The more coins they wager,
    the higher the probability of validation. This reward can include an annual
    percentage return, and the exact amount depends on the blockchain
    technology used. In addition, Proof of Stake is considered the most
    environmentally friendly option nowadays.
</p>
<p>
    So far, we can distinguish between the following validation mechanisms for
    which the most known tokens are included below:
</p>
<h3>
    Proof of Work
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Bitcoin
    </li>
    <li>
        Ethereum
    </li>
    <li>
        Dogecoin
    </li>
    <li>
        Litecoin
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Proof of Stake
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Solana
    </li>
    <li>
        Cardano
    </li>
    <li>
        Algorand
    </li>
    <li>
        Tezos
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Ethereum Merge
</h2>
<p>
    Ethereum, the blockchain behind ether, could soon launch its long-awaited
    Merge update. The EIP will mean the end of Proof of Work for the Ethereum
    network, transitioning completely to Proof of Stake. Although the final
    schedule for this update is unknown, it is known that it will render
    cryptocurrency mining, based on proof-to-work, obsolete. This process,
    called Beacon, allows users to stake ether to support the blockchain and
    earn returns around 4% to 5%, Some industry experts predict that rewards
    with Merge will range from 7% to 12%.
</p>
<p>
    However, like everything else, staking has some side effects.
    Proof-to-stake essentially bets on the viability of the cryptocurrency
    being staked, so it is subject to the volatility of those digital assets.
    Added to this are potential restrictions on how quickly a cryptocurrency
    can be withdrawn after wagering, certain penalties for not actively
    validating transactions, or minimum amounts required to wager, among other
    issues.
</p>
<p>
    Some myths related to this upgrade are that the high fees of Ethereum will
    be reduced. This is not true and how gas works in Ethereum will not be
    changed. Another misconception was that a new token would be created with
    Ethereum Merge. This is also not true, and Ethereum’s cryptocurrency – ETH
    – will remain the same. In general, the main goal of the Ethereum Merge
    update is making Ethereum cryptographic mining obsolete, reducing its    <strong>environmental impact</strong>, together with enhanced security
    against potential attacks.

<h2>
    What’s next for Ethereum?
</h2>
<p>
    Having seen that Ethereum is evolving, this can have interesting benefits
    for investors and users. In the past years, the rise of NFTs is also thanks
    to Ethereum. Some astonishing figures have been seen in the news in 2021
    and 2022. However, this is completely another topic
</p>
<p>
    Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has been very concerned about the
    future of the blockchain and the use of NFTs (non-fungible tokens).
    According to him, cryptocurrencies were not created "to play with
    million-dollar monkeys, but to do meaningful things in the real world."
</p>
<p>
    In the face of the somewhat uncontrolled boom in non-fungible tokens,
    Buterin believes that many people are not taking advantage of the true
    potential of ether and its blockchain. In particular, he refers to the NFT
    Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, the collection of primate cartoons that have
    become a status symbol in the digital age and for which more than $1
    million has been paid.

    In Buterin's view, Ethereum's potential should be harnessed to change the
    world for the better: from fairer voting systems to urban planning and
    public works projects. In particular, he believes the platform could serve
    as a counterweight to authoritarian governments and even end Silicon
    Valley's stranglehold on the digital lives of millions of people.

<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    There are several interesting projects out there and you may participate on
    those while generating passive income without many efforts. In this post,
    we have briefly introduced what Ethereum Merge will mean. However, in
    future posts we will describe other cryptocurrencies such as Algorand,
    which already use the PoS validation method.
</p>
<p>
    In general, via Staking, we can benefit of diversification, growing our
    income without big efforts. There are different platforms offering
    different APY for several coins, giving us the possibility of some juicy
    returns without doing nothing. Some of these platforms are Nexo or BlockFi.
    Nonetheless, as promised, we will get into details and see on how we can
    start with this.

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    Since temperatures go up, we are already in Spring, and we will be soon in
    summer, the fashion companies have started adapting their
    collections.
</div>
<p>
    For that reason, Massimo Dutti, as every almost every year, has launcher
    their limited edition for the Spring Summer, with a clear nod to summer and
    fresh style.
</p>
<p>
    Massimo Dutti presented some days ago (end of March) the Limited Edition
    SS22 and it is already available for purchase. For this time, taking
    advantage of the rising temperatures, the collection is set in the Maghreb
    region.
</p>
<p>
    Since this post is mainly about the different new looks and articles, it
    will be shorter than other post of this website
</p>
<p>
    Coming back to the collection, the campaign photography is made by Josh
    Olins and the thematic for this campaign is linen, nature, and summery
    vibes. That’s why most of the shots are taken in desert landscapes of the
    North African region.
</p>
<p>
    In this collection, Massimo Dutti focuses on the main characteristics, with
    no specific preference:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Purity and nature
    </li>
    <li>
        Sharp silhouettes
    </li>
    <li>
        Natural colors
    </li>
    <li>
        Nods to Craftsmanship
    </li>
    <li>
        Light garments
    </li>
    <li>
        Comfortable fabrics
    </li>
    <li>
        Classic patterns
    </li>
    <li>
        Avant garde point of view
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These attributes are aligned with the brand’s principles and culture. At
    the same time, Massimo Dutti still bets on the look of a sober man with
    classic taste, as well as cosmopolitan and open to change. You can see also
    this culture applied in other campaigns such as the Join Life collections
</p>
<p>
    The preferred materials are also focused on nature and adapt to warmer
    months of the year. That’s why MD has opted for materials such as linen,
    leather, or different blends of knitwear.
</p>
<p>
    Aligned with choice of the materials and landscapes, they try to evoke non
    artificial man. As opposed to other brands, it is difficult that you will
    see synthetic materials in the fabrics, and you will mainly see natural
    fabrics such as the ones mentioned for this collection.
</p>
<h2>
    My favorite pieces of the collection
</h2>
<p>
    In this post, I am selecting the most charismatic and unique pieces from
    this collection. However, I invite you to visit the website to find any
    other garment that could be interesting for you too.
</p>
<h3>
    Navy Blue Linen Blazer
</h3>
<p>
    The pandemic is being normalized and even if some of us are already back in
    the office, I would also expect that progressively most of us have to go to
    the office. For summer months, I remember that it was a nightmare to wear
    suits in hot places such as Spain or Greece. For these specific climates,
    linen suits and blazers may be a good alternative for work and events.
</p>
<p>
    If you go for lighter fabrics and materials, this will fix the problem and
    you will wear the suit or blazer more comfortably as well as a great style.
</p>
<p>
    Single breasted is still the preferred choice for most men. However, this
    double-breasted blazer can be a good item to distinguish from other typical
    suits. You can combine with the trousers of the same blazer or with more
    casual garments such as jeans.
</p>

    </a></span>
</p>
<h3>
    Leather toiletry bag
</h3>
<p>
    This collection also adds interesting and high-quality accessories. For
    your home or when you are on trip, it’s a good idea to invest in a good
    toiletry bag.
</p>
<p>
    This one is made on leather with an elegant pattern, and it is big enough
    to put all the things you need before and after shower. For similar items
    from more famous brands, you will pay 5 – 10 times more.
</p>

    </a></span>
</p>
<h3>
    Suede overshirt
</h3>
<p>
    The next item is delicate, and you should not use it for rainy days.
    However, wearing a suede overshirt will elevate your look. Besides, you can
    also combine this garment in multiple ways. As mentioned, this is the most
    delicate item of the list, but if you have the chance this is a good
    investment for your wardrobe.

    </a></span>
</p>
<h3>
    Leather Espadrilles
</h3>
<p>
    The known as Alpargatas in Spain, it is a typical product from Spain, used
    in this country, the south of France and some regions of America. Known as
    a humble shoe and evolved from the Egyptian and Roman sandals, Massimo
    Dutti has redesigned this shoe for this collection. This model is kept
    simple, but adds some sophisticated final touches, resembling in some cases
    the woven design of Bottega Venetta.

    </a></span>
</p>
<h3>
    Beige Shawl collar cardigan
</h3>
<p>
    The weather is getting warmer and drier, but on summer night, we will need
    to add some layers depending on where we are. Wearing a wool or cashmere
    sweater in the months of summer may be excessive. Instead, trusting in
    lighter materials such as cotton would make a great balance. This shawl
    collar cardigan can be the great choice for these cases and as you can see
    the color is also more appropriate for these months.
</p>

<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    Normally, I prefer the Autumn / Winter season, since the one for Spring /
    Summer you have less options. In Winter, it is also more common that we
    have more layers and that’s why we have more options to play with.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of the women collection, you will of course have more
    alternatives. However, I’m sure you can find something interesting in this
    collection too.
</p>
<p>
    We have focused in the 5 most interesting pieces of the collection for me,
    but as said, I’m sure you can also find your next hidden gem when visiting
    these links.

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    Intermittent fasting brings several benefits in different aspects such as
    health, recovery, or weight loss. While this trend has been very famous recently in the western culture,
    there are some benefits of the 16/8 rule (26 hours fasting and 8 hours for having meals).
    Due to the different advantages, some different cultures of the world have been applying this for centuries.
</div>
<p>
    In this post we discuss some of the benefits that intermittent fasting can
    bring to our life. We had also tried to validate most of the benefits with
    some scientific studies.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from the different tests, I have been using this for many years now
    and I can tell you that my health and my state of form has improved during
    this time. Here are some benefits for the long-term that fasting could
    bring to your life.
</p>
<h2>
    Weight and fat
</h2>
<p>
    Many people who try <a name="OLE_LINK1"></a>    <a name="OLE_LINK2">intermittent </a>fasting do so to lose weight. In
    general, intermittent fasting will cause you to eat fewer meals and
    therefore, a reduction of calories.
</p>
<p>
    Unless you offset this by eating a lot more during other meals, you will
    end up consuming fewer calories. Further, intermittent fasting improves
    hormone function to facilitate weight loss.
</p>
<p>
    Lower levels of insulin, higher levels of MBH, and higher amounts of
    norepinephrine (noradrenaline) increase the breakdown of body fat and
    facilitate its use to generate energy. For this reason, short-term fasting
    increases the metabolic rate, helping burn even more calories than in
    normal situations.
</p>
<p>
    In other words, intermittent fasting has two functions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It increases your metabolic rate
    </li>
    <li>
        It reduces the amount of food you eat
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    According to a 2014 review of the scientific research, intermittent fasting
    can cause a weight loss of 3 percent to 8 percent in 3 to 24 weeks. This
    amount is huge.
</p>
<p>
    A 2011 review also showed that intermittent fasting caused less muscle loss
    than continuous calorie restriction.
</p>
<h2>
    Sugar and Diabetes
</h2>
<p>
    Diabetes 2 is one of the diseases growing faster in the last decade. Its
    main characteristic is high blood sugar levels in the context of insulin
    resistance.
</p>
<p>
    Anything that reduces insulin resistance should help lower blood sugar
    levels and protect against type 2 diabetes. Intermitting fasting can help
    with this.
</p>
<p>
    For example, intermittent fasting has been shown to have major benefits for
    insulin resistance and cause an impressive reduction in blood sugar levels.
</p>
<p>
    In human studies on intermittent fasting, fasting blood sugar was reduced
    by 3 percent to 6 percent over the course of 8 to 12 weeks in people with
    prediabetes. Fasting insulin was reduced by 20 percent to 31 percent.
</p>
<p>
    What does this mean? intermittent fasting may be highly protective for
    people who are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/fasting/fasting-book.jpg" alt="Multiple Benefits">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Although it may take some time to get adapted, fasting brings multiple benefits</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Heart
</h2>
<p>
    Coronary problems and heart disease is currently the disease killing most
    people in the world. Related to this problem, several risk factors are
    known to be associated with an increased or decreased risk of heart
    disease.
</p>
<p>
    Intermittent fasting has been shown to improve several different risk
    factors, including:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
        blood sugar levels
    </li>
    <li>
        blood pressure
    </li>
    <li>
        blood triglycerides
    </li>
    <li>
        (bad) cholesterol
    </li>
    <li>
        inflammatory markers
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>
    Cellular Recovery
</h2>
<p>
    When we fast, the body's cells initiate a cellular "waste disposal" process
    called autophagy.
</p>
<p>
    This process involves cells breaking down and metabolizing broken and
    dysfunctional proteins that accumulate within cells over time.
</p>
<p>
    Increased autophagy may protect against several diseases, including cancer
    and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
</p>
<h2>
    Brain
</h2>
<p>
    We have discussed different benefits and advantages for our body. What is
    good for the body is often also good for the most important organ, our
    brain.
</p>
<p>
    Intermittent fasting improves several metabolic functions that are known to
    be important for brain health.
</p>
<p>
    Intermittent fasting helps to reduce:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        blood sugar levels
    </li>
    <li>
        oxidative stress
    </li>
    <li>
        inflammation
    </li>
    <li>
        insulin resistance
    </li>
    <li>
        Fasting also increases levels of a brain hormone called brain-derived
        neurotrophic factor (BDNF). A deficiency of BDNF has been implicated in
        depression and various other brain problems.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Other studies have also shown that intermittent fasting protects against
    brain damage due to stroke.
</p>
<h2>
    Hormones
</h2>
<p>
    When you don't eat for a period of time, several things happen in your body
    related to the hormones and internal organs.
</p>
<p>
    For example, your body changes hormone levels to make stored body fat more
    accessible and initiate important cellular repair and recovery processes.
</p>
<p>
    These are some of the hormones changes that occur thanks to fasting:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Insulin levels. Insulin levels in the blood drop significantly, making
        it easier to burn fat.
    </li>
    <li>
        Human growth hormone (HGH) levels. Blood levels of human growth hormone
        (HGH) can increase dramatically. Higher levels of this hormone make it
        easier to burn fat and build muscle and have many other benefits.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cellular repair. The body induces important cellular repair processes,
        such as removing waste from cells.
    </li>
    <li>
        Gene expression. There are beneficial changes in several genes and
        molecules related to longevity and disease protection.
    </li>
    <li>
        Many of the benefits of intermittent fasting are related to these
        changes in hormones and cells
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Stress
</h2>
<p>
    Oxidative stress is one of the steps towards aging and many chronic
    diseases. We all want to avoid this. It involves unstable molecules called
    free radicals. Free radicals react with and damage other important
    molecules, such as protein and DNA.
</p>
<p>
    Several studies show that intermittent fasting can improve the body's
    resistance to oxidative stress. In addition, studies show that intermittent
    fasting can help fight inflammation, another key component in many common
    diseases.
</p>
<h2>
    Cancer
</h2>
<p>
    Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and it’s also one of
    the most problematic diseases.
</p>
<p>
    Fasting has been shown to have several beneficial effects on metabolism
    that may reduce the risk of cancer.
</p>
<p>
    Promising evidence from animal studies indicates that intermittent fasting
    or diets that mimic fasting may help prevent cancer. Research in humans has
    had similar findings, although more studies are needed. There is also some
    evidence that fasting reduced several side effects of chemotherapy in
    humans.
</p>
<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    Although we have been taught that breakfast is the most important of the
    day, this is due to the interest of the food industry in the past decades.
    We should forget about this myth and follow what it’s good for our body.
</p>
<p>
    Related to some questions you may have questions about what you can do and
    cannot do.
    It’s perfectly fine to drink water, coffee, or tea as long as you don’t put
    sugar. Furthermore, it is also fine to put a small amount of milk.
</p>
<p>
    Probably the hardest time is starting with the intermittent fasting and it
    may not be made for every person. I can just tell my experience about it
    and the different noticeable that has brought to me. I hope this can be of
    any use to you in your life. In this post we have seen different benefits
    and you may also take this into account if you would like to start with it.
