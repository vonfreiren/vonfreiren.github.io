<p>A few months ago, we discussed the most important changes that the Ethereum Merge would bring and in fact delivered to the users. With this change, as you know, the most significant change was that the “old” Proof of Work was replaced by the Proof of Stake Protocol.</p>

<p>These are basically the most important changes that are possible now thanks to the Merge.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Improved energy efficiency: PoS uses less energy compared to PoW, which is expected to significantly reduce Ethereum’s carbon footprint.</li>
  <li>Increased scalability: The merge made the Ethereum network more scalable, as PoS can process more transactions per second compared to PoW.</li>
  <li>Enhanced security: PoS is designed to prevent 51% attacks, which are a significant concern with PoW consensus mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Changes to the mining ecosystem: The merge eliminated the need for miners, as PoS relies on validators who stake their ETH to secure the network.</li>
  <li>EIP-1559 integration: The upgrade included integration of EIP-1559, which introduced a new fee structure for Ethereum transactions, making the network more user-friendly.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="from-london-to">From London to…</h2>

<p>However, these changed had not been possible without the fork that occurred the year before. Back in 2021, this network change, also known as the London upgrade, made the following modifications in the Ethereum network.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>EIP-1559</strong>: This change introduced a new transaction pricing mechanism that aims to improve the predictability and transparency of Ethereum gas fees, which can often be unpredictable and volatile. It also burned a portion of the fees collected, which reduces the overall supply of Ethereum, potentially increasing its value.</li>
  <li><strong>EIP-3198</strong>: This change reduces the gas cost of certain types of transactions, making them cheaper for users.</li>
  <li><strong>EIP-3529</strong>: This change increased the difficulty of certain types of DDOS attacks that can slow down or crash the Ethereum network.</li>
  <li><strong>EIP-3541</strong>: This change prepared the network for the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, seen above, by removing certain features that will no longer be needed.</li>
</ol>

<p>These implementations caused them to make the network more energy-efficient, secure, and scalable, while also changing the mining ecosystem and introducing new fee structures. However, as also announced in the Merge, this is not over, and the Ethereum Foundation never stops with the continuous improvements.</p>

<p>Having listed it several EIP, it may seem that there are no enhancements left for do in the Ethereum. Nonetheless, this is quite far from reality and if you to the Ethereum Improvement Proposals website you will see more and more suggestions.</p>

<h2 id="shanghai">Shanghai</h2>

<p>So now, with all the background and knowing the most important changes occurred in the last 2 years explained, let’s focus on the Shanghai upgrade.</p>

<h2 id="5-new-eip-coming">5 New EIP Coming</h2>

<p>Even if the Merge was the big upgrade, there are 5 EIP expected to come in a few weeks from now. When? It’s expected that these changes may pop up around mid-March. However, based on the experience with previous integrations, it will not be surprising that this fork in the network is slightly delayed.</p>

<p>The upgrade of Ethereum, also known as the Ethereum Shanghai fork, will implement five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), and compared to the previous forks, there are several changes related to the fees.</p>

<h3 id="eip-4895">EIP-4895</h3>

<p>Out of these five proposals, EIP-4895 is expected to receive the most attention. The upgrade will allow Ethereum investors to withdraw their staked ETH for the first time since December 2020. This lock was needed in order to use this as validation mechanism and protect the network.</p>

<p>Some of the fears that this had raised is that there may be a lot of withdrawals when this change becomes effective. However, because of some withdrawal caps and other rewards- higher staking -, it’s unlikely that we will see massive withdrawals.</p>

<p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895</a></p>

<h3 id="eip-3855">EIP-3855</h3>

<p>At the moment, the EVM does not have a PUSH0 instruction, and the goal will be to reduce the gas consumption by introduction this instruction in the virtual machine.</p>

<p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855</a></p>

<h2 id="eip-3860">EIP-3860</h2>

<p>EIP-3860 is an extension of the old EIP-170 and seeks to lower transaction costs for developers when interacting with smart contracts.</p>

<p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860</a></p>

<h3 id="eip-3651">EIP-3651</h3>

<p>To execute transactions in the network, it is necessary to interact with the Coinbase machine – nothing to do with the Exchange - several times. The initial interaction requires a higher fee as the software needs to “warm up,” but as interactions increase, fees decrease.</p>

<p>This proposal will ensure that the Coinbase software remains “warm”, resulting in a reduced gas fee to access it.</p>

<p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3651">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3651</a></p>

<h3 id="eip-6049">EIP-6049</h3>

<p>EIP-6049 is a notification mechanism to developers regarding code known as “SELFDESTRUCT that aims to reduce gas fees.</p>

<p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6049">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6049</a></p>

<h2 id="what-after-shanghai">What after Shanghai?</h2>

<p>These upgrades should improve network usage in DeFi and NFTs. Even the initiator of them, some detractors complained that high gas fees and slow transactions affected some of these ecosystems.</p>

<p>With these improvements, old and new projects may consider Ethereum more favorably, which was losing momentum to newer and chains with lower fees.</p>

<p>Greater flexibility in staking, better performance, and an increase in stakeholders could amplify the resulting network effect sand benefit all stakeholders (users, investors, etc.) in the long run.</p>

<p>The objective of these changes is not just to continue improving the Ethereum performance, but also try to reduce the churn of some DeFi or NFT projects to more affordable networks such as Polygon or Solana, like we have seen in marketplaces like OpenSea or other applications in the last years.</p>

<p>As consequences of part Blockchain Trilemma, Ethereum has been plagued with sluggish transactions and high fees, which became more evident during the decentralized finance boom a few years ago.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the trend of minting them in 2021 and early 2022 added to poor user experiences and high gas fees. These EIPs are mainly focused on this topic. Their aim to help mitigate these problems and convince users that Ethereum is the best network for the different projects and dApps.</p>

<p>As we have seen, this will not be the end, and this is just the follow-up to get a more scalable network. This will be achieved when features such sharding are included in the chain in a few months from now.</p>

<p>Achieving sharding will be crucial for enhancing transaction throughput on the chain by enabling “parallel processing.” The implementation of sharding is expected to occur in two stages in 2023 and 2024.</p>

<p>Although small change compared to the PoW – PoS migration occurred in 2022, this upgrade makes sure that Ethereum, one of the oldest blockchains, keeps up good progress and for sure will convince old and new users of the chain.</p>]]></content><author><name>Javier Freire</name></author><category term="Crypto" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After London, and the Merge, the Ethereum network is preparing for the next big upgrade.

<div class="text-article">

Today in the afternoon, I received an email from INSEAD announcing that they are offering a new specialization called Web3 and Blockchain in Global Commerce Specialization. I received this message in my mailbox, I guess because I took several courses from INSEAD related to Blockchain in the past.



</div>

<p>I did not have the chance to go in detail about this specialization, but it sounds interesting to learn new concepts and refresh the ones I learned a few years ago. I also thought that it could be relevant to other people sharing my experience with other courses.</p>

<p>This post is not about this specialization and I will describe more about it when I complete it. Nonetheless, this purpose of this article is to show the readers that even if it’s sometimes not easy to start into the Blockchain world and industries, there are several resources out there that can help you in this mission. We already saw of these resources in another post, so this post will talk mainly about more traditional courses that I enjoyed.</p>

<h2 id="blockchain-revolution">Blockchain Revolution</h2>

<h3 id="organization-insead">Organization: INSEAD</h3>

<p>The Blockchain Revolution course on Coursera is an in-depth exploration of the concepts, applications, and implications of blockchain technology. The course is taught by Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott in collaboration with INSEAD. Both both well-known experts in the field of blockchain and the course is now several years old. The new specialization of the introduction is also taught by the father and his son.</p>

<p>The course is divided into several modules, each of which covers a different aspect of blockchain technology. The first module introduces the basic concepts of blockchain and provides an overview of how it works.</p>

<p>The second one delves deeper into the technical aspects of blockchain, including the various types of consensus algorithms and the role of cryptography in securing blockchain networks.</p>

<p>The third module explores the various applications of blockchain technology, including its potential use in finance, supply chain management, and digital identity verification. The fourth module looks at the potential societal impact of blockchain, including its potential to disrupt traditional power structures and create new economic opportunities.</p>

<p>The fifth module focuses on the practical aspects of building and deploying blockchain solutions, including how to design a blockchain network, select the right consensus algorithm, and ensure security and scalability.</p>

<p>The final module of the course explores the future of blockchain technology, including emerging trends and the potential impact of blockchain on various industries. It’s here where the student can put all the learned lessons to work and create a project that will need to submit.</p>

<p>In these courses, the instructors use real-world examples and case studies to illustrate the potential of blockchain technology. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of how blockchain works, its potential applications, and the implications of this technology for businesses, governments, and society as a whole.</p>

<p>If this course was not enough, there is a similar specialization also taught by the Tapscott family and INSEAD. This one comes next in our list.</p>

<div class="text-article">
Despite facing numerous obstacles in 2022, emerging market equities began to show signs of recovery in the last quarter of 2022. This trend is expected to continue during 2023 due to factors such as robust growth, declining inflation, a softening US dollar, and favorable fundamentals.

</div>

<p>In light of the widespread decline in equity markets during 2022, emerging market equities are believed to be one of the most undervalued asset classes, offering attractive valuations compared to historical norms. Just have a look at some metrics such as the Price Earnings Ratio and it is one of the most attractive ones in recent years.</p>

<p>When it comes to bonds, the outlook for emerging market debt, which faced a difficult landscape in 2022, is now considered to be more positive. The combination of high yields, favorable valuations, and a supportive global environment, including the potential for growth in China, creates the opportunity for equity-like returns in the mid-teens over the next year in both hard and local currency debt.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened-recently">What happened recently?</h2>

<p>But before we start, what happened when back in 2020, we expected emerging markets such as China to be the clear winners of the COVID pandemic?</p>

<p>In 2022, the MSCI EM Index experienced a decline of around 20%. When all the spotlights were on China, they heavily disappointed last year. Other BRIC countries such as Russia did not help either. Korea – although just considered as Emerging for the MSCI index and not in the FTSE index -</p>

<p>This focus on innovation and growth trends can have a significant impact on investment performance. In 2021, the MSCI EM ex-China Index outperformed the MSCI China Index by a margin of 32 percentage points, showcasing the benefits of<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> actively </code>targeting emerging market equities. Regions such as Argentina, India, or Turkey had something to do with this performance.</p>

<p>However, as said, we have seen some signs of improvements in the last weeks. In the last quarter of the year, the asset class saw a resurgence, rising by nearly 10% as a result of China’s efforts to reopen its economy and support for the real estate sector to reignite economic growth. In terms of sector performance, communication services performed the best, followed by health care, materials, and real estate. Furthermore, there were some indices such as the Turkish or Argentinian ones that achieved<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> excellent </code>results, even if their local currency devaluated even more.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, energy, utilities, and consumer staples lagged behind the index during the quarter. The strong recovery seen in the fourth quarter of 2022 bodes well for the future of emerging market equities in 2023. Let’s take a closer look at some of the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> key </code>factors that will drive growth in the coming year.</p>

<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/emerging_markets_2025/machu.jpeg" alt="Hidden secrets" />
    <span class="caption text-muted">Some Latin American countries can be the next hidden gem, considering that they have been reviled for some time </span>
</p>

<p>Despite facing difficulties in 2021 and 2022, such as slow vaccine distribution and the emergence of the Delta variant, there is potential for a rebound in emerging market (EM) economies. However, risks still persist. A potential catalyst for recovery could be a rise in interest rates, which is expected to bring developed-market GDP back to its trend line.</p>

<p>An<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> active </code>strategy in emerging market (EM) equities has the potential to outperform a US equity strategy in the next decade, as populations in EM countries grow and innovation continues to expand. The equity valuations in EM markets are relatively attractive, and earnings growth is currently at a decade-high. The region is home to many of the world’s top-performing companies, but these firms may not be included in standard benchmarks, which tend to heavily weight state-owned enterprises and industries that rely on exports. An<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> active </code>investment approach can provide investors with greater exposure to companies that are experiencing growth driven by secular trends.</p>

<h2 id="long-term-vision">Long-term vision</h2>

<p>Emerging markets are set to play a significant role in the global economy not just until 2025, but in the next decade. Despite facing challenges such as economic instability, political unrest, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, these markets have shown remarkable resilience and are poised for growth in the coming years.</p>

<p>One of the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> key </code>drivers of growth in emerging markets is their rapidly growing populations, which provide a large pool of consumers for both local and foreign businesses.</p>

<p>This, combined with increasing urbanization, rising incomes, and growing middle classes, creates a favourable environment for investment.</p>

<p>Another factor contributing to the growth of emerging markets is technological advancements, particularly in the areas of digital infrastructure, e-commerce, and fintech. This is providing new opportunities for businesses to reach customers and drive innovation in these markets.</p>

<p>In 2023 and 2024, some of the top emerging markets to watch include China, India, Brazil, Russia, and South Africa. These countries offer a diverse range of investment opportunities across various industries, including technology, healthcare, and infrastructure. The astonishing returns that occurred in the Turkish and Argentinian indices are not expected to continue in 2023.</p>

<p>China, with its large and growing middle class, is expected to continue to drive growth in Asia, while India is poised to become a major player in the global economy, thanks to its large and youthful population. In South America, the 2 big players, Brazil and Argentina, are set to benefit from a rebound in commodities prices and increased investment in infrastructure.</p>

<p>Russia, meanwhile, is poised to benefit from a recovering oil market, while South Africa is expected to see growth driven by its mineral resources, including gold and platinum.</p>

<p>You may have a look at some of these countries in this <a href="https://mrfreire.net/top-emerging-countries-2022/">article</a></p>

<h2 id="beware-of-the-risks">Beware of the risks</h2>

<p>However, while emerging markets offer significant opportunities, they also come with risks. Political and economic instability, currency fluctuations, and regulatory challenges are among the risks that investors must consider when investing in these markets.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, emerging markets are expected to continue to play an increasingly important role in the global economy over the next two years. With the right investment strategy, they offer the potential for high returns, while also helping to diversify portfolios and mitigate risk.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the next years are set to be exciting years for emerging markets, with opportunities for growth and investment in a range of industries. The prices we see are very attractive as entry level.</p>

<h2 id="research-and-where-to-start">Research and where to start</h2>

<p>As always, careful research and a well-considered investment strategy will be<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> key </code>to realizing the full potential of these dynamic and rapidly growing markets. However, instead of cherry-picking stocks, the best solution for most of us would be and index in order to collect returns from all countries.</p>

<div class="text-article">
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the` potential `to revolutionize the way we work and improve` productivity `across various industries. In the software development industry, AI is already being used to improve` productivity `in several ways.</div>

<p>One of the most common ways AI is being used to improve software<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>is through the use of code completion tools. These tools use AI algorithms to suggest code snippets or complete entire lines of code based on the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> context </code>of the current project. This can save developers a significant amount of time and effort by reducing the need for manual coding. Some examples of code completion tools include DeepTabNine, Kite, and TabNine.</p>

<p>Coding is a complex and time-consuming task that requires a lot of focus and attention to detail. However, there are many tools available that can help you improve your<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>and streamline your workflow. In this article, we will discuss some of the most popular tools that you can use to improve your coding productivity.</p>

<p>There are different ways to increase what we do in less time. IDEs, project management tools and methodologies or automations tools and some of these examples. Probably some of these improvements can also come from non-technology methods, but improving our lifestyle, focus and nutrition.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we will leave them for another time. Today we are going to discuss what AI can do in terms of efficiency. We are going to show two of the benefits of using them in our daily life. For this article, we will focus of one of the state-of-the-art tools, both of them powered by the OpenAI codex.</p>

<h2 id="github-copilot">GitHub Copilot</h2>

<p>Starting with Microsoft, GitHub Copilot is a powerful AI-powered code completion<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> tool </code>that allows developers to write code more efficiently and with fewer errors. This powerful<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> tool </code>can help developers to increase their<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>by reducing the time it takes to complete repetitive or complex tasks.</p>

<p>One of the main features of GitHub Copilot is its ability to provide code<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> suggestions </code>as developers type. This can help to save time by eliminating the need to manually search for the correct syntax or function. Additionally, Copilot also provides context-aware suggestions, which means that it can suggest different options based on the specific<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> context </code>of the code.</p>

<p>Another useful feature of GitHub Copilot is its ability to automatically fix common coding errors. This can save developers a significant amount of time, as they no longer need to spend time searching for and fixing errors. Additionally, Copilot can also help to improve code quality by suggesting improvements and best practices.</p>

<p>In addition to these features, GitHub Copilot also offers advanced functionality such as code refactoring, which can help developers to simplify and improve their code. This can be particularly useful when working on large and complex projects, as it can help to make the code more maintainable.</p>

<p>To use GitHub Copilot, developers need to have a GitHub account and the GitHub extension for IntelliJ,Pycharm, Visual Studio Code or your favorite IDE . Once the extension is installed, developers can start using Copilot by opening a new file or by hovering over a function or variable.</p>

<h2 id="chatgpt">ChatGPT</h2>

<p>ChatGPT is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI that can be used to increase coding productivity. It is a state-of-the-art machine learning model that can be used to generate code, complete code snippets, and even write entire programs.</p>

<p>One of the main benefits of using ChatGPT for coding is its ability to generate code quickly and accurately. With ChatGPT, developers no longer have to spend hours writing code from scratch or searching through documentation to find the right syntax. Instead, they can simply provide ChatGPT with a brief description of what they want to accomplish, and the model will generate the necessary code.</p>

<p>Another benefit of using ChatGPT for coding is its ability to learn from existing code. The model can analyze existing code and use that knowledge to generate new code that is consistent with the existing style and structure. This means that developers no longer have to spend time trying to conform to a specific coding style, as ChatGPT can automatically generate code that follows the style of the existing codebase.</p>

<p>Additionally, ChatGPT can also assist in code refactoring and bug fixing. It can analyze the code, find bugs and suggest fixes, or even generate the fix itself. This can save a lot of time and effort for developers who would otherwise have to manually scan through the code to find and fix bugs.</p>

<p>Another great feature of ChatGPT is its ability to write comments and documentation. This can be extremely helpful for developers who are working on complex projects and need to document their work. ChatGPT can analyze the code and generate comments and documentation that explain what the code is doing and how it works.</p>

<p>Furthermore, ChatGPT is a powerful<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> tool </code>that can be used to increase coding<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>in several ways. It can generate code quickly and accurately, learn from existing code, assist in code refactoring and bug fixing, write comments and documentation, and even generate entire programs. By incorporating ChatGPT into their workflow, developers can save time and effort while also improving the quality of their work.</p>

<p>On another hand, ChatGPT also has the ability to generate entire programs. It can take a high-level description of what the program should do and generate the entire codebase for it. This can be especially useful for developers who are working on proof-of-concepts or prototypes.</p>

<p>Of course, ChatGPT is no error-proof and due to the stored data, it could be the case that some code or libraries are old and/or deprecated. However, when writing one of the generated errors triggered in suggested blocks of code, ChatGPT will apologize for that and suggest new changes that will work. This is some of the situations several people have encountered. Once Microsoft complete the acquisition and ChatGPT has access to real time data, we will see what this<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> tool </code>is capable of.</p>

<p>We have seen that GitHub Copilot is a powerful<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> tool </code>that can help developers to increase their<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>by reducing the time it takes to complete repetitive or complex tasks. With its ability to provide code suggestions, automatically fix common coding errors and suggest improvements, Copilot can help developers to improve the quality of their code and increase their efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="a-lot-of-new-things-to-come">A lot of new things to come</h2>

<p>All of these features combined can greatly increase coding<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>and help developers focus on the more important aspects of their work such as designing and implementing new features, and solving complex problems.</p>

<p>To conclude with this short article AI is already being used to improve software<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>in several ways, and it is likely that its use will continue to expand in the future. By automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, AI can help developers to focus on more complex and creative tasks, ultimately leading to better software and more efficient development processes.</p>

<p>We are still on very early stages of the AI revolution. If all this is possible now, imagine what could be done when there is more data available, and we the different training models can be continuously improved in order to improve the loss function and enhance the different predictions. We have not yet seen the real power of AI, and it will still take some time until we are close to it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Javier Freire</name></author><category term="Work" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to software development, AI tools can really help the different developers to improve their work and to make it more efficient.

<div class="text-article">
Nomad work refers to a type of work that is not tied to a specific location or office, and can be done from anywhere in
the world with an internet connection. This type of work is becoming increasingly popular as more and more people are
able to take advantage of the flexibility and freedom that it offers. Besides, more and more companies are embracing
remote work and the use of technology makes it easier to stay connected and productive from any location.</div>

<p>Working from anywhere refers to the ability to do your job from any location, as long as you have access to the
necessary tools and resources. popular as the use of technology makes it easier to stay connected and productive from
any location.</p>

<p>If you don’t like monotony, who would not be willing to work while skiing in the Italian Alps, sunbathing in the Spanish
Canary Islands or diving in the exotic Bali?</p>

<h2 id="how-to-do-it">How to do it</h2>

<p>There are different types of nomad work, including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remote work</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">freelancing</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">digital nomadism</code>. Remote work
refers to any type of work that is done remotely, usually from home or a coworking space. Freelancing refers to working
as a self-employed individual, offering services to clients on a project-by-project basis. Digital nomadism is a
specific type of nomad work that involves traveling the world while working remotely.</p>

<p>One of the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> main </code>benefits of nomad work is the flexibility it offers. Instead of being tied to a specific location or
office, nomad workers have the freedom to choose where they want to work from. This allows them to work from home, a
coffee shop, a coworking space, or even from a different country.</p>

<p>Another benefit of working remotely is the ability to choose your own schedule. Many nomad workers have the freedom to
set their own schedule and work when it is convenient for them. This can be especially beneficial for those with
children or other responsibilities that make it difficult to work a traditional 9-5 job.</p>

<p>Nomad work also allows for a better work-life balance. Since nomad workers are not tied to a specific location, they
have the ability to travel and<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> experience </code>new cultures while still being able to work. This can be a great way to see
the world and have new experiences while still making a living.</p>

<p>However, nomad work is not for everyone. It can be challenging to stay motivated and focused when you are working from
home or a coworking space, and it can be difficult to build a professional network when you are constantly on the move.
It is also important to be self-disciplined and organized when working as a nomad, as there may not be the same level of
structure and oversight as there is in a traditional office setting.</p>

<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/nomad/japan.jpeg" alt="Travel more, discover new things" />
    <span class="caption text-muted">Having the benefit or chance of working from anywhere is a great opportunity to discover new countries and cultures. Maybe after that visit you would like to relocate this new place</span>
</p>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<p>These are some tips to help you when changing your mind and embracing this new lifestyle:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Determine your work needs: Consider what type of work you do and what resources you need in order to be productive.
This will help you determine the best location for your nomad work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find a reliable internet connection: A strong and stable internet connection is essential for nomad work, so make
sure you have access to one<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> wherever </code>you go.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set boundaries: It can be easy to get caught up in work when you are a nomad, so it is important to set boundaries
and make sure you take breaks and have a healthy work-life balance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stay organized: Nomad work can be disorganized at times, so it is important to have systems in place to keep track of
your work and stay on top of tasks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find a community: It can be lonely working as a nomad, so it is important to find a community of like-minded
individuals who can provide support and connection. This can be through online groups or by joining a coworking
space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plan for the future: Nomad work is not for everyone, and it is important to have a plan in place for the future in
case you decide to transition back to a more traditional work arrangement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protect your finances: Nomad work can be unpredictable, so it is important to have a financial safety net in place to
protect yourself in case of unexpected expenses or income fluctuations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stay in touch with home: Working abroad can be exciting, but it can also be homesickness. Make sure to stay in touch
with friends and family back home and keep them updated on your adventures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find temporary housing: If you will be working in a country for an extended period of time, it is a good idea to find
temporary housing rather than staying in a hotel. This can be more cost-effective and will also allow you to get a
better feel for local life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take care of your physical and mental health: It is important to prioritize your physical and mental health when you
   are a nomad, as it can be easy to neglect self-care when you are constantly on the move.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, nomad work offers many benefits, including flexibility, freedom, and the ability to choose your own schedule
and work from anywhere. However, it is not for everyone, and it is important to carefully consider whether it is the
right fit for you before making the decision to become a nomad worker.</p>

<p>Employees who are can enjoy working from anywhere may have more flexibility in their schedules, which can be especially
beneficial for those who have non-traditional work schedules or who may have difficulty taking time off due to family or
other commitments.</p>

<p>This aspect does not just benefit the employee, but the enterprise. Employees who have this type of flexibility are also
able to work more hours, be more creative and more productive. Furthermore, taking<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> holidays </code>should not be the only time
we have to visit other countries or regions.</p>

<p>Is the shift to remote work a temporary trend caused by the latest pandemic or a permanent change in the way we do
business? I think the last one, and I also have the opinion that still a lot of<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> corporations </code>have still to discover this
range of possibilities. Let’s hope I’m right about this last thought.</p>]]></content><author><name>Javier Freire</name></author><category term="Work" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How working remotely can benefit you and your employer.

<div class="text-article">
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning are two closely related fields that have garnered a lot of attention in
recent years. AI is a broad term that refers to the ability of a machine or computer program to simulate human
intelligence and perform tasks that typically require human cognition, such as learning, problem-solving, and
decision-making.</div>

<p>Deep learning, on the other hand, is a subset of AI that uses large neural networks with multiple layers of processing
to learn and make decisions based on data.</p>

<p>The<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> history </code>of AI can be traced back to the 1950s, when<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> researchers </code>began exploring the possibility of creating machines
that could perform tasks that required human intelligence.</p>

<p>Early AI research focused on creating algorithms that could mimic human decision-making processes and problem-solving
abilities. However, the limitations of computing power at the time meant that these early AI systems were not able to
handle the large amounts of data and complex calculations required for more advanced tasks.</p>

<p>The rise of the internet and the availability of large datasets in the 1990s provided a major boost to AI research. This
led to the development of new algorithms and techniques, such as decision trees and support vector machines, that could
handle large amounts of data and make more accurate predictions. However, these algorithms still relied on human input
to define the rules and criteria used to make decisions, which limited their ability to learn and adapt to new
situations.</p>

<p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses large neural networks with multiple layers of processing to learn and make
decisions based on data. These networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain, with each layer of neurons
performing a specific function and passing information to the next layer for further processing. Unlike traditional AI
algorithms, deep learning algorithms do not require human input to define the rules and criteria used to make decisions.
Instead, they are able to learn from the data they are given and improve their performance over time.</p>

<h2 id="deep-learning">Deep Learning</h2>

<p>One of the key advantages of deep learning is its ability to handle unstructured data, such as images, audio, and text.
This has made it particularly useful in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech
recognition, where traditional AI algorithms struggle to make sense of complex and unstructured data. For example, deep
learning algorithms have been used to develop image recognition systems that can accurately identify objects in images,
and language<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> translation </code>systems that can accurately translate text from one language to another.</p>

<p>Deep learning has also been used in a variety of other fields, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. In
healthcare, deep learning algorithms have been used to identify patterns in medical images that may indicate the
presence of certain diseases, such as cancer. In finance, deep learning algorithms have been used to analyze large
amounts of market data and make predictions about stock prices and other<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> asset </code>classes.</p>

<p>Despite these advantages, there are also challenges and limitations to the use of deep learning. One of the main
challenges is the need for large amounts of data to train the algorithms, which can be difficult to obtain in some
applications. In addition, deep learning algorithms can be complex and difficult to interpret, making it difficult to
understand why they make certain predictions or decisions. This can be a problem in applications where explainability is
important, such as in medical diagnosis or financial decision-making.</p>

<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>

<p>The future of deep learning looks bright, with<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> researchers </code>and companies continuing to invest in this field to develop
new applications and technologies. In the next few years, we can expect to see deep learning algorithms become even more
powerful and versatile, with the ability to handle even larger and more complex datasets.</p>

<p>One of the key areas where deep learning is expected to have a significant impact is in healthcare. Deep learning
algorithms are already being used to analyze medical images and identify patterns that may indicate the presence of
certain diseases. In the future, we can expect to see these algorithms become even more accurate and able to handle a
wider range of medical data, such as genomics and electronic health records. This could potentially lead to more
personalized and effective treatments for patients, and help healthcare providers to diagnose and treat diseases more
efficiently.</p>

<p>Another area where deep learning is expected to have a major impact is in transportation. Deep learning algorithms are
already being used in self-driving cars to enable them to navigate roads and avoid obstacles. In the future, we can
expect to see these algorithms become even more advanced, with the ability to handle a wider range of driving conditions
and scenarios. This could potentially lead to the development of safer and more efficient self-driving cars, and pave
the way for the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p>In addition, deep learning is also expected to play a significant role in the development of smart cities. Deep learning
algorithms can be used to analyze large amounts of data from sensors and other sources to identify patterns and trends,
and help city planners and policymakers to make more informed decisions. For example, deep learning algorithms could be
used to analyze traffic data to optimize the flow of vehicles on roads, or to monitor energy usage in buildings to
improve efficiency.</p>

    <span class="caption text-muted">In fields such as Medicine, Deep Learning is already being used to analyze medical images and identify patterns that may indicate the presence of certain diseases.</span>
</p>

<h2 id="deep-learning-and-the-workforce">Deep Learning and the workforce</h2>

<p>The rise of deep learning has had a significant impact on the workforce, with many companies and industries starting to
adopt this technology to improve efficiency and productivity. Deep learning algorithms are able to learn from large
amounts of data and make predictions and decisions based on that data, which makes them well-suited for a wide range of
tasks and applications.</p>

<p>One of the key ways that deep learning is being used in the workforce is in automating tasks that were previously
performed by humans. Many companies are using deep learning algorithms to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks,
such as data entry and analysis, customer service, and scheduling. This allows employees to focus on more complex and
value-added tasks, and can improve overall productivity and efficiency.</p>

<p>However, the widespread adoption of deep learning in the workforce has also raised concerns about job displacement. As
deep learning algorithms become more advanced and are able to perform more tasks, there is a risk that they could
replace human workers in many industries. This could potentially lead to job losses and increased unemployment, and
could have a negative impact on the economy.</p>

<p>To address this concern, it is important for companies and policymakers to invest in training and education programs
that can help workers acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to work<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> alongside </code>deep learning algorithms and adapt to
new technologies. This could include training programs in areas such as data analysis, programming, and machine
learning, which can help workers to develop the skills needed to work with deep learning algorithms and other emerging
technologies.</p>

<p>In conclusion, deep learning is having a significant impact on the workforce, with many companies using this technology
to automate tasks and improve efficiency. While this has the potential to bring many benefits, it also raises concerns
about job displacement and the need for workers to adapt to new technologies. To address these challenges, it is
important for companies and policymakers to invest in training and education programs that can help.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, the future of deep learning looks very promising, with the potential to transform a wide range of industries
and applications. As deep learning algorithms continue to evolve and become more powerful, we can expect to see even
more exciting other useful applications in this field.</p>

<p>During this period, more and more people jumped into the crypto world. In some cases, they did not have a previous
investment background and this phenomenon opened many doors in the retail industry. Furthermore, some famous people and
investment firms also promoted this change. Besides, Investment banks that had criticized Bitcoin in the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> past </code>changed
their mind and some of these firms started also offering these alternative assets to their clients.</p>

<p>On one hand, the central banks low-interest or quantitative easing policies caused a huge increase on the price of the different
crypto assets. Another topic that helped with this was the creation of different communities such as Bored Apples or
CryptoPunks</p>

<p>If we put everything into the mix, we saw what we saw with the explosion of NFTs that occurred some years ago and the
adoption of these in the society.</p>

<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>

<p>However, although NFTs may be linked to pictures or avatars, there are a lot of areas beyond this topic where NFTs can
play a great role, either now or in the years to come. Although it may seem interesting too, we will not talk about the
several millions that were paid to acquire some NFTs in auction houses such as Christie’s or on-chain.</p>

<p>If you have not realized about the potential across sectors that NFTs have, you will probably see that these will impact
for good these sectors in the future.</p>

<h3 id="art">Art</h3>

<p>With the democratization of art, this means that all artists can promote their creativity and by doing so, they are also
able to reach to more people. With NFTs, you and only you are the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> owner </code>of these unique pieces. Who know where the next
Picasso or Dali will be? This means that art lovers and the search of the next gem is not limited to just some
privileged collectors with good connections, but to everyone who loves art and beauty.</p>

<h3 id="videogames">Videogames</h3>

<p>Non-Fungible Tokens have a lot of possibilities when it comes to the gaming industry. The boom of online video games,
e-sports and open world games have helped achieve this. If we think about the most iconic series, several utilities can
be proposed.</p>

<p>For example, in MOBA games such as League of Legends, having a unique skin and spell effects for you character could not
just improve your gaming experience but also trade with them after you get tired of it.</p>

<p>Although the normal price of skins is considerably low, this means that they are not unique, and you may see all the
time the same ones when playing the game. Knowing the number of fanatic gamers, it would be interesting for some of them
to have a unique skin that would make other players jealous. For companies, it would need to be checked whether this
business model makes sense (high volume and low price or selling just one single skin for several thousands of dollars)</p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>

<p>Instead of collecting limited edition vinyl records or CDs, the next step in our constantly changing world could be
having the original copy or even special edition versions or unreleased remixes of top hits. Instead of having the
physical copy you would have it registered in the blockchain.</p>

<p>For musicians and DJs, this can be a great very interesting mechanism, same as art makers, to promote their job and
access to different users<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> around </code>the world. This also removes intermediaries that take a big piece of the cake.</p>

<p>For example, if you like EDM and you go to festivals often, you may have noticed that recently the songs that the
different DJs play are the ones that are being played everywhere, and they tend to play the latest hits. You may have
seen this in festivals such as Ultra or Tomorrowland. This makes the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> music </code>sessions not as original as before.</p>

<p>If you attend one of these sets, this can be the only time you can hear a specific unreleased song because they are the
sole owners of this one. Some collectors may be interested on this specific version and request the artist to buy it.</p>

<p>In connection to the commercial side of this feature, since you are the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> owner </code>of this song, you could set a
subscription/reproduction fee if someone wants to play your song.</p>

    <span class="caption text-muted">Nostalgic collectors may not think the same, but collecting` music `in new format files add many new possibilities and reduces problems such as storage or conservation of old formats
</span>
</p>

<h3 id="videos">Videos</h3>

<p>The movies sector didn’t change much in the last decade until Covid arrived. Starting 2020, since people could not go
out, there were several days for some long-awaited movies. In other cases, that they allowed was to offer the movies via
some streaming platforms.</p>

<p>However, what could really revolutionize the art of collecting records of the different movies would be the chance of
having original and unique recordings, such as shorts or cut scenes of your favorite movie. If you think about fans of
the most well-known sagas such as Star Wars or the Godfather, these items could have an exponential increase in a few
years from now.</p>

<h3 id="tickets">Tickets</h3>

<p>Imagine going to a football game or concert. This is nothing unusual and something that everyone has done. If you for
example go to a world cup final, you may record videos, etc., but one of the things probably you will want to keep it
for this unique experience will be the tickets of the match you attended.</p>

<p>The same could be applied to other events. Imagine going to last tour of your favorite<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> music </code>band before they split or
retire. This is also something quite unique that would like to keep, and it’s probably that something will increase their
value with the years should you want to sell it later.</p>

<h3 id="creating-and-minting-nfts">Creating and minting NFTs</h3>

<p>The good thing about the NFTs is that the steps to create them are quite easy. It’s not correct that in order to take
part in these topics you are required to have a technical profile. You may have heard the term “Mint”. This is basically
registering the NFT on the blockchain, which in this case will show that belong to your wallet. Obviously, you will need
to create something unique, for which you will need to show some creativity and originality. However, once you completed
your first work, the steps can be summarized as follows:</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-wallet">Creating a Wallet</h3>

<p>If you are new to the crypto world, don’t be afraid of terms. Creating a wallet is something that not many people do at
the moment, but I can guarantee that as with other technologies, in the future everyone will have their own wallet where
they can keep and guard their assets without the need of a middleman. As just discussed, this is something that anyone can do
regardless of their background and technology skills.</p>

<p>Some of the most popular wallets out there are Metamask, Coinbase Wallet or Phantom.</p>

<h3 id="choosing-the-chain">Choosing the chain</h3>

<p>The choice of the wallet is linked to the blockchain where you operate and the marketplace where you want to show your
item. Some blockchains you may consider are Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Tezos. The chain you use will have an impact
in the site or platform where you want to show your NFTs. As with the wallet, the marketplace you choose in the second
point is also linked to this step.</p>

<h3 id="selecting-the-nft-marketplace">Selecting the NFT marketplace</h3>

<p>Some of the most famous sites to trade NFTs are OpenSea, Magic Eden or Rarible and they offer different However, as we
discussed in the introduction, you see more and more often new places dedicated to certain niche markets.</p>

<p>If you are new into this world, some benefits of OpenSea is that you don’t pay any gas fees when minting and
these fees are just paid if you sell your NFT.</p>

<h3 id="tokenizing-the-nft">Tokenizing the NFT</h3>

<p>When creating the NFT, it is recommended to<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> provide </code>additional information and not just the basic details. For example,
include some details like the name, the collection, and other technical details.</p>

<h3 id="showing-and-selling-the-nft">Showing and selling the NFT</h3>

<p>Once you have linked your wallet to the desired site, you can just show your collection, sell the items, or buy new NFTs
to add to your collection. In this example, I just included the basic steps, but of course the industry is constantly
evolving, and you will see new wallets, marketplaces and chains.</p>
