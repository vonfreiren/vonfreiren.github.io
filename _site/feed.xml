    Introducción
</h2>
<div class="texto-artículo">
    <p>
        Hace algunos siglos, diferentes organizaciones en Europa y Asia fueron
        acusadas de conspiraciones y polémicas. La mayoría de estas acusaciones fueron
        provocados por la información que estas sectas o grupos guardaban para sí mismos.
        Mito o realidad, lo que no se puede negar es que en la Edad Media,
        el conocimiento era algo considerado hermético y exclusivo de ciertos grupos
        y esa sabiduría estaba restringida a ellos y los miembros exclusivos de su círculo.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    Afortunadamente, las cosas han cambiado en las últimas décadas y en esta era de
    información, tenemos más acceso a cosas que no podríamos haber imaginado unos pocos
    hace años que. Por otro lado, puede resultar chocante y paradójico que en
    esta era, somos menos cultos e informados.

    </em> -
    <strong>

</p>
<br>
<p>
    El conocimiento es motivación suficiente para que la mayoría de nosotros aprendamos sobre nuevos temas,
    pero aparte que si te digo que aparte de aprender temas interesantes
    y tecnologías de punta también puede ser recompensado?
</p>
<p>
    Como se discutió en artículos anteriores, la mejor inversión que puede hacer es
    aprendizaje. Es innegable los beneficios que trae el aprendizaje continuo
    a largo plazo.
</p>
<p>
    Aunque el aprendizaje por sí mismo ya es una experiencia gratificante y motivadora, algunas personas también valorarán beneficios adicionales. Mantenernos actualizados es importante en el mundo competitivo en el que todos vivimos.
    No solo por ahora, sino para los próximos años.
    Por recompensa, no me refiero solo a la nueva información o los beneficios que obtiene, sino
    nuevos tokens, monedas, descuentos u otro tipo de beneficios que se pueden obtener.
</p>
<p>
    Esta publicación no se trata solo de obtener monedas gratis, sino también de nuevas habilidades que
    puedes obtener y aplicar en tu mundo profesional. Profundicemos para ver
    cuáles son estas opciones.
</p>
<br>
<h2>
    Programas Learn to Earn
</h2>
<p>
    El primer grupo de este artículo está relacionado con aquellos programas en los que
    aprenda la teoría o los conceptos básicos de una cadena de bloques o token determinado. En
    las subsecciones a continuación, no solo aprende algo nuevo, sino que también
    tenga la oportunidad de ser recompensado con criptomonedas.
</p>
<p>

    <span class="caption text-muted">En la sección Learning Rewards puedes ver diferentes artículos, cursos y cuestionarios</span>
</p>
<p>
    Estos son algunos de los programas Learn to Earn más famosos que existen, donde
    aprendes nuevos temas interesantes y eres recompensado de diferentes maneras.
</p>
<p>
    Hay que tener en cuenta que estos cursos no tienen ningún requisito como
    “deposita 10 para ganar 20, etc.”. Aparte de aprender y leer/ver el curso y responder a las preguntas, el único otro requisito es que en algunos casos puede necesitar
    para verificar y pasar los controles KYC.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    Coinbase
</h3>
<p>
    Coinbase a veces es criticado por diferentes razones, como
    temas relacionados con el negocio (despido de empleados, plan de negocios) o la
    tarifas comerciales. Sin embargo, desde que comenzaron en 2018, han impulsado
    diferentes iniciativas en la comunidad crypto. Uno de los más famosos
    es el programa Learning Rewards, donde los usuarios pueden ganar diferentes tokens. los
    El proceso es bastante fácil y solo ver un video corto y responder algunas
    preguntas puede obtener algunos tokens gratis.
</p>
<p>
    No hay sorpresas aquí y puedes cambiar tan pronto como lo recibas. los
    las recompensas no son una gran cantidad, pero, últimamente, tienden a ocurrir con bastante frecuencia.
    Independientemente de las recompensas, los videos son agradables de ver y están muy bien hechos.
    Además de estos videos, también podrá ver diferentes artículos.

<h3>
    Binance
</h3>
<p>
    Binance es, sin duda, el intercambio de criptomonedas más grande del mundo.
    En mi opinión, el exchange chino basado inicialmente puede ser bastante molesto con
    varias notificaciones diarias, pero la organización de Changpeng Zhao también promueve
    varias iniciativas agradables y valiosas para sus clientes.
</p>
<p>
    Desde 2022, han seguido lo que comenzó Coinbase y ofrecen algunos pequeños
    recompensas por ver algunos videos y responder diferentes preguntas. Ahí
    Son varios cursos, y las recompensas son bastante pequeñas. Sin embargo, es útil y beneficioso
    para entender y conocer nuevos proyectos, y además de aprender y
    obtener nuevas ideas, ser recompensado por ello.

<h3>
    Cake DeFi
</h3>
<p>
    Cake DeFi es un jugador bastante nuevo en el sector de las finanzas descentralizadas y ahora
    bastante conocido para muchas personas. Sin embargo, con sus soluciones actuales, es probable que escuches de ellos cada vez más. Cake DeFi son una empresa
    DeFi con sede en Singapur especializada en ingresos pasivos, siendo los principales pilares de
    estas plataformas las siguientes:
</p>
<p>
    1. Liquidity Mining: a diferencia de los exchanges centralizados, en un DEX, la líquidez
    es necesario para permitir intercambios entre los diferentes pares. Con
    minería de liquidez que proporciona sus activos criptográficos para que otros puedan usarlos para
    comercio.
</p>
<p>
    2. Staking: a través del protocolo Proof of Stake, bloquea sus tokens para proteger
    la red., y obtienes recompensas con tokens adicionales
</p>
<p>
    3. Lending: la última estrategia es el ingreso generado al prestar sus monedas
    a otros participantes de DeFi.
</p>
<p>
    Con los cursos disponibles, en este momento puedes ganar los siguientes
    tokens
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Tokens DFI (DeFiChain)
    </li>
    <li>
        Tokens BTC-DFI
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Ambos están asignados a la Staking y Liquidity Mining, pero después de haber hecho "unfreeze" se puedes hacer lo que se desee con las monedas que tienes ese obtuvieron en el curso más los que obtuvo del período de congelación.
</p>
<p>
    Próximamente también habrá un curso relacionado con Ethereum, en el que también
    aprender algo nuevo y ser recompensado.

<h3>
    Revolut
</h3>
<p>
    Revolut es muy bueno para muchos aspectos, como banca, conversión de moneda,
    viajar y las características geniales de la aplicación, como tarjetas virtuales o
    transferencias instantáneas. Sin embargo, cuando se trata de sus características de inversión tales
    como la compra de acciones o criptomonedas, todavía hay algunos aspectos que deben ser
    mejorados.
</p>
<p>
    Probablemente por eso, para despegar, Revolut ha lanzado Learn
    &amp; Gana Programa relacionado con Polkadot. En comparación con otros cursos, las lecciones están relacionadas con una de las blockchains más importantes y la
    las cantidades también son más altas.
</p>
<p>
    Además de los vídeos, también tienes la opción de ver el glosario, donde se explican algunos términos importantes de criptografía y blockchain.
</p>
<p>
    No hay un programa de referencia aquí y obtendrá esos tokens por usted.
    Tú decides si los quieres vender por fiat o cambiarlos en el momento que los recibes.

<h2>
    Cursos Técnicos y Sitios
</h2>
<p>
    Aunque los cursos anteriores te recompensarán con tokens directos y
    los de abajo no lo harán, dada la falta de habilidades técnicas que veremos en el futuro, los cursos a continuación pueden tener una recompensa más relevante en los próximos
    años.
</p>
<p>
    Una vez que nos hemos centrado en describir los cursos más importantes relacionados con
    negocios y blockchains, también podemos ser más técnicos y en este tema, también hay muy buenos cursos para sumar nuevas habilidades.

<br>
<h3>
    Uniswap
</h3>
<p>
    Uniswap, llamado así por el nombre de la empresa que lo creó, es uno de los exchanges descentralizados más famosos. Aparte del exchange y siendo un ejemplo de gobernanza, Uniswap explica claramente muy
    temas importantes relacionados con DeFi.

<h3>
    Ethernaut
</h3>
<p>
    Probablemente haya escuchado recientemente sobre la fusión de Ethereum y las
    consecuencias que la bifurcación puede tener no solo para la red Ethereum sino
    toda la escena criptográfica. Ethernaut es un juego de guerra que se juega en un Ethereum
    Máquina virtual y desarrollado por OpenZeppelin, Ethernaut es una
    aplicación Web3 desarrollada con Solidity, donde también puedes aprender este
    lenguaje de programación de una manera amena e interactiva.

<h3>Conclusión</h3>
<p>
    Como ocurre con muchas cosas en la vida, el mejor aprendizaje es la práctica. Por lo tanto,
    simple o complejo, ¿por qué no comienza a crear su propio proyecto una vez que sepa
    los conceptos básicos? Tenemos el privilegio de vivir en una era donde la información es
    accesible para todos con un nivel infinito de recursos.
</p>
<p>
    Como se puede ver en los enlaces, los cursos técnicos pueden requerir más tiempo,
    por lo que sería mejor comenzar a aprender los conceptos básicos de los primeros sitios web.
</p>
<p>
    Con las nuevas tecnologías y el crecimiento esperado, estas tecnologías
    eliminar varios puestos de trabajo, pero habrá escasez de empleo y las empresas no
    capaz de contratar nuevos talentos porque hay muy pocos profesionales con la
    habilidades requeridas. Uno de ellos puede ser blockchain y todo lo que
    rodea esta industria.

<div class="text-article">
    <p>
        Some centuries ago, different organizations across Europe and Asia were
        accused of conspiracies and polemics. Mostly these accusations were
        provoked by the information that these sects or groups kept for themselves.
        or Myth or reality, what cannot be denied is that in the Middle Ages,
        knowledge was something considered hermetic and exclusive to certain groups
        that wisdom for them and the exclusive members of their circle.
    </p>

<p>
    Fortunately, things have changed in the last decades and in this era of
    information, we have more access to things we could not have imagined a few
    years ago. On the other hand, it may be shocking and paradoxical that in
    this era, we are less cultivated and informed.

    Knowledge is enough motivation for most of us to learn about new topics,
    but apart what if I tell you that apart from learning interesting topics
    and state of the art technologies you can also get rewarded?
</p>
<p>
    As discussed in previous articles, the best investment you can make is
    learning. It’s undeniable the benefits that the continuous learning brings
    in the long term.
</p>
<p>
    Although, learning by itself is already a rewarding and motivating
    activity, some of use will also appreciate additional bonuses. Keeping us updated is important in the competitive world we all live in.
    Not just for now, but for future years.
    By reward, I don’t mean just the new information or benefits you get, but
    new tokens, coins, or discounts you may get.
</p>
<p>
    This post is not merely about getting free coins, but also new skills that
    you can get and apply in your professional world. Let’s dig deeper to see
    what these options are.
</p>
<br>
<h2>
    Learn to Earn Programs
</h2>
<p>
    The first group of this article is related to those programs where you
    learn the theory, or the basic concepts of a given blockchain or token. In
    the subsections below, you don’t just learn something new, but you also
    have the chance of getting rewarded with crypto currencies.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/learn_earn/coinbase.jpg" alt="Pioneer">
    <span class="caption text-muted">In the Learning Rewards Section you can see different articles, courses and quizzes</span>

<p>
    These are some of the most famous Learn to Earn programs out there, where
    you learn interesting new topics and you are rewarded in different manners.
</p>
<p>
    Please bear in mind that these courses do not have any requirements such as
    “deposit 10 to earn 20, etc.”. Apart from learning and reading/watching the
    information, the only other requirement is that in some cases you may need
    to verify and pass the KYC checks.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    Coinbase
</h3>
<p>
    Coinbase is sometimes criticized for different reasons such as
    business-related topics (dismissal of employees, business plan) or the
    trading fees. However, since they started in 2018, they have promoted
    different initiatives in the crypto community. One of the most famous ones
    is the Learning Rewards program, where users can earn different tokens. The
    process is quite easy and just watching a short video and answering some
    questions you can get some free tokens.
</p>
<p>
    There is no surprise here and you can exchange as soon as you receive. The
    rewards are not a big amount, but, lately, they tend to occur quite often.
    Regardless of the rewards, videos are nice to watch and very well done. In
    addition to these videos, you may also see different articles.

<h3>
    Binance

<p>
    Binance is without any doubt, the largest crypto exchange in the world. In
    my opinion, the initially based Chinese exchange may be quite annoying with
    several daily notifications, but Changpeng Zhao’s organization have also
    several nice initiatives for their customers.
</p>
<p>
    Since 2022, they have followed what Coinbase started and offer some small
    rewards for watching some videos and answering different questions. There
    are several courses, and the rewards are quite small. However, it is nice
    to understand and be aware of new projects, and in addition to learning and
    getting new ideas, being rewarded for so.

    Cake DeFi
</h3>
<p>
    Cake DeFi is a quite new player in the Decentralized Finance sector and now
    quite known for many people. However, with their current solutions, it is
    likely that you will get hear from them more and more. They are a company
    based in Singapore specialized in passive income, being the main pillars of
    these platform the following s
</p>
<p>
    1. Liquidity mining: as opposed to centralized exchanges, in a DEX, liquidity
    is needed in order to enable trades between the different pairs. With
    liquidity mining you provide your crypto assets so other can use these to
    trade.
</p>
<p>
    2. Staking: Via the Proof of Stake protocol, you lock your tokens to protect
    the network., and you get rewarded with additional tokens
</p>
<p>
    3. Lending: The last strategy one is income generated from lending your coins
    to other DeFi participants.
</p>
<p>
    With the available courses, you can at the moment earn the following
    tokens.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        DFI (DeFiChain) tokens
    </li>
    <li>
        BTC-DFI Tokens
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Both of them are allocated to Staking and Liquidity mining, but after you
    unfreeze them you can do whatever you want with the coins you got in the
    courses plus the ones you got from the freeze period.
</p>
<p>
    There is also a course coming soon related to Ethereum, where you will also
    learn something new and get rewarded.

    instant transfers. However, when it comes to their investment features such
    as purchasing stock or crypto, there are still some aspects that should be
    improved.
</p>
<p>
    That’s probably why in order to take off, Revolut has launched a Learn
    &amp; Earn Program related to Polkadot. Compared to other courses, the
    lessons are related to one of the most important blockchains and the
    amounts are also higher.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the videos, you have also the option to see the glossary,
    where some important crypto and blockchain terms are explained.
</p>
<p>
    There is no referral program here and you will get those tokens for you.
    You decide if you want to sell them for fiat or exchange them the moment
    you receive them.

    Although the previous courses will reward you with direct tokens and the
    ones below will not, given the lack of technical skills that we will see in
    the future, the courses below may have a more relevant reward in upcoming
    years.
</p>
<p>
    Once we have focused described the most important courses related to
    business and blockchains, we can also get more technical and in this

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    As with many things in life, the best learning is practicing. Therefore,
    simple, or complex, why don’t start creating your own project once you know
    the basics? We are privileged to live in an era where information is
    accessible for everyone with infinite level of resources.
</p>
<p>
    As you may see from the links, the technical courses may require more time,
    so it would be better to start learning the basic concepts from the first websites.
</p>
<p>
    With new technologies and the expected growth, these technologies will
    eliminate several jobs, but there will a job shortage and companies not
    able to hire new talent because there are too few professionals with the
    required skills. One of them may be blockchain and everything that
    surrounds this industry.

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    <p>
        We are in this time of the season where airports are packed and there is a
        peak of flights when everybody is taking one or more flights to go to the
        planned destination some weeks before. Despite the petrol price, different
        strikes, and other inconveniences, after two years of the COVID pandemic,
        the flight levels are back to 2019 levels and the predictions for the next
        years are quite optimistic.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    This can be explained by the benefits that flying brings and the
    limitations and restrictions. we had in the last 2 years. The freedom that
    was taken from us made us value more the possibility of having now the
    possibility to choose where to go.
</p>
<p>
    Related to this, the first thing we know is that experiences are better
    than possessions. With the millennials, we have been an increasing
    prioritization of these experiences over possessions such as houses or
    cars.
</p>
<p>
    The trip of our dreams is something that we look forward to and our goals
    is how to fly more and how to find good deals when looking for these trips.
    It’s something we include in the wishes for the next year.
</p>
<p>
    Although some useless governments are now with the idea of reducing the
    number of flights or other nonsense regulations, who cares about what they
    say? Although topics such as pollution or energy management are constant
    problems, maybe they should be the first ones to apply these rules and
    avoid their usual useless trips.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, why not benefit from more and affordable trips during the year?
    In order to achieve this, there are some steps that we need to consider.
</p>
<p>
    They are not complex at all, but these are some tricks in order to help you
    with your next trip.
</p>
<h2>
    Planning
</h2>
<p>
    The first phase is the initial planning phase. It does not require a big
    effort but leaving everything unplanned or for the last minute will
    generate unnecessary stress that may ruin our trip. If planned accordingly,
    this will solve different situations and will get you a better price,
    flight and stay. In this case, one suggestion would be to start looking for
    flights some months before the trip. This will ensure that you can analyze
    the different options and mitigate possible risks.
</p>
<p>
    One of the most heard questions is whether is better to spend 1 month in a
    location or have 3 trips in different locations.
</p>
<p>
    Although I prefer in general quality over quality, when it comes to trips
    it is just the opposite. I’m in favor of having more than one. This can be
    achieved by carefully selecting affordable options. Picking 3 flights of
    300 instead of 1 of 1,000 will in my opinion a better choice.
</p>
<p>
    However, this opinion is not based on the price aspect, but also on
    diversification. For example, if you go to one destination for 1 month and
    for whatever reason you don’t like it, the weather is very bad, etc. the
    single trip for the year is ruined. With more options, you diversify more
    and if you travel 3 or 4 times per year, it’s not likely that all of them
    will be a bad choice.
</p>
<h2>
    Adapt to the options
</h2>
<p>
    If you are looking for an exact destination and you suddenly come with a
    super cheap price, It may look the best thing in the world. However, this
    will not be always the case.
</p>

<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/cheap_flights/google_flights.jpg" alt="Essential application">
    <span class="caption text-muted">As we can see in the list of tools, having additional technological support is a must for our search</span>
</p>
<p>
    Despite this may be what we are aiming to achieve, ff you try to hit in the
    middle of the bullseye, you may be a lifetime waiting for it. Flexibility
    is the currency that you may use to get more trips with better prices.
</p>
<p>
    It’s just the opposite. The piece of advice here should be starting to look
    for cheap affordable locations. From that list, you will probably find
    several destinations that may be attractive to you.
</p>
<p>
    You may start by selecting different price ranges within your budget. Out
    of all destinations, you may select the ones with the lowest prices and
    from there you can start selecting which destinations may fit more. Even if
    some of them may not be very attractive, this can be a good opportunity to
    discover the next gem.
</p>
<p>
    It’s often where we see that people go to the same destinations: Paris,
    Madrid, London, etc. These places are normally overcrowded and it’s likely
    that you have already visited. Why not looking something less mainstream?
</p>
<p>
    As said before, being flexible is the attribute that will open more doors
    and get you better deals. First of all: direct flights may be more
    expensive. In this case, there are different options such as different
    flights, companies, dates or even alternative transport methods.
</p>
<p>
    When it comes to short flights, one alternative could be going by
    car/train/bus to a close airport. You may have the option of the parking,
    staying at some friend’s place or even visiting another city before the
    flight.
</p>
<p>
    In some countries, the train will be quite cheap if booked in advance and,
    if you are looking for an international flight, another possibility would
    be to use 2 companies and go first to the connection point. There, you can
    visit the city (1 day trip). Normally, these cities have many inhabitants,
    and you may know someone who you can visit or even he may let you stay for
    the night.
</p>
<p>
    The trick in these cases is to have a good margin between the first and
    second flight. If for some reason, there is no time left to leave the
    airport for a short visit to the city, another advice is to get some
    accessories that will make your trip much easier:
</p>
<p>
    Battery charger, eBook or book, and headphones. Another trick is that
    without or bad connection to use the laptop to work on work or personal
    project. If you don’t have Internet connection, you will not get disturbed
    by constants notifications.
</p>
<p>
    In the last 21 days, prices will skyrocket. You may have seen too many The
    Simpsons episodes (e.g., when they go to Japan), but it is unlikely that
    you will get a last-minute deal. These prices are high because are more
    focused on business travelers who don’t have any other alternative and they
    (the company) will pay the ticket fare.
</p>
<h2>
    Some tools
</h2>
<p>
    When it comes to additional help, there are hundreds of tools on the
    Internet that can be used to keep track the different offers. For example:
    Kayak, Skyscanner, Google Trips or your own tools.
</p>
<p>
    For example, in my case using Python and MongoDB I have created a tool that
    checks flights with multiple destination and dates combinations and will
    store the best option (duration and price) for each combination on each
    day. The cheapest option on each day is stored and the moment the price
    goes down, it sends you an alert. Playing with alerts on the service you
    may use is off the essence.
</p>
<p>
    Since we were discussing the flexibility, I have found that Google Flights
    allows including many origin and destination airports on the same search.
    With this useful feature, you can get the best deals with one single
    search. You can also add notifications. The disadvantage with Google
    Flights is that some flights may not appear.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/cheap_flights/mongodb.jpg" alt="Basic but working">
    <span class="caption text-muted">This is the basic applicaiton that just collects the flight information such as the price, duration, destination and origin. Once there is a decrease in the price, it sends an email to inform about the change.</span>
</p>
<p>
    Another trick is to book on those airline companies that offer free
    cancellation. This way you make sure that the highest price you will pay in
    your search will be the one you already had and everything you get below
    that is your gain.
</p>
<h2>
    Other tricks
</h2>
<p>
    Saving in flights means that your budget for doing other trips,
    restaurants. Instead of going to a 4-start restaurant, you may end up in a
    5-star hotel and go to Michelin-starred restaurants. Therefore, you should
    invest in planning and flexibility because this way you can spend the money
    in more important things.
</p>
<p>
    Although it may sound strange to you with the recent surge in travel
    tickets due to inflation, strikes and gas prices, prices are each year
    lower. This is due to big competition in the airline industry. It’s a
    regulated sector with several years of history and since World War II
    prices have been decreasing – after adjusting the price considering
    inflations –
</p>
<p>
    Then, how do airlines make money? While flying was a premium some years
    ago, luckily it has been accessible to more and more people. The revenue
    sources have changed too. As opposed to some decades ago, we that revenues
    do not come mainly from the ticket, but from other extras such as baggage
    fees, seat fees, other products, bundles, business trips, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Another question you may have seen is on which day to book the flight. How
    does this algorithm work?
</p>
<p>
    There is no specific day or hour where you may find the best price.
    Although you may have heard different opinions based on different sources,
    there is no specific time where you will get the best price.
</p>
<p>
    However, one thing is to consider. Mondays and Fridays are normally the
    most expensive days because these are the days where business trips take
    place. People will get on the plane to a specific destination and come back
    on Friday. For short trips, this is also the best time in order to spend
    the whole weekend abroad.
</p>
<p>
    Excluding these days, the best days are Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday.
    Again, this does not mean that they will be always the cheapest flights.
</p>
<p>
    When it comes to months, August is traditionally the most expensive month
    (some people don’t have any choice for holidays) and Christmas. Therefore,
    selecting the correct dates may also be a relevant factor.

    The rules above are quite general and there is no written rule. It may be
    that one day a flight ticket from Net York to Amsterdam is 600 and the day
    after is 300 EUR. For this reason, it’s important to benefit from
    technology and your favorite tool and get noticed as soon as this change
    occurs.

<h2>
    Key takeaways
</h2>
<h3>
    Plan and plan
</h3>
<p>
    Don’t leave things for the last minute. Have a good planning will have
    benefits on both the stress and the price you will end paying for the
    tickets or any other service you may need.
</p>
<p>
    Start looking in advance is also key. Depending on the type of flight, you
    should start looking between 2 to 8 months in advance.
</p>
<p>
    Booking at the earliest date does not always mean the cheapest price but
    waiting for the last minute will always mean a high price.
</p>
<h3>
    Flexibility
</h3>
<p>
    If you want to travel as much as possible during the year, be flexible.
    Don’t start looking for one single destination. Open your mind and look for
    affordable places you may not even know they exist. Learn about them. As
    mentioned above, it’s key to plan accordingly. Once you have investigated
    if you would like to go to one of the placed that popped up, see if this is
    the place where you would like to stay. In many cases, because of the low
    expectations, these can be a total surprise and you may want to come the
    year after again.
</p>
<h3>
    Tools
</h3>
<p>
    Use technology with some many tools available, we can really benefit of
    instant notifications when we find a good deal. In some cases, it may be
    difficult to configure some alerts but

    What’s I the right price? How should I risk? When should I pull the
    trigger? These questions require practice and knowing the different routes
    or companies. Even if I have no plans to fly, what I normally do is also
    setting up some alerts where I can see the different prices and the price
    evolution. Remember that time is against you, so the moment you find a good
    deal after having performed the different steps, just go for it.

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    <p>
        It’s true that some of the most wanted and known watches will be out of
        budget for most of us. We have seen that the prices of luxury watches have
        gone to the roof in the last years. They have been mainly used for
        investment, hedging and protection against inflation, similar to what’s
        done with other alternative assets. That’s main reason for having seen the
        prices in primary and secondary markets skyrocketed. Although even if it
        said that watches are an investment on many occasions, in most cases this
        will not be true and even if you are an experienced professional, it would
        not be advisable to follow these steps.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    Anyway, the topic of this article is not to discuss about luxury articles
    or investments, but the opposite. In this post, the focus is to show some
    affordable but good-looking watches that will look like a luxury watch and
    will not disappoint any watch collector.
</p>
</p>
</p>
<h2>
    1. Orient Bambino
</h2>
<p>
    We start the list with a fine piece coming from Japan. It may be a
    non-famous brand for some, but Orient belongs to the Seiko group
</p>
<p>
    The Orient Bambino is possibly one of the best affordable automatic dress
    watches available on the market today. A piece appreciated even by the most
    demanding collectors, despite not being a high value jewel.
</p>
<p>
    Essentially, we are dealing in this case with a vintage-style watch with a
    clean and traditional design equipped with a precise mechanism, whose
    quality is endorsed by Orient, a Japanese watch brand whose tradition dates
    back to 1950, although it currently belongs to Seiko, another guarantee of
    quality.
</p>
<p>
    The best thing about the Orient Bambino is that they move in a fairly
    affordable price range, so they are an excellent starting point for those
    who want to start collecting watches without spending a fortune, but who
    also want to be recognized among others. the connoisseurs in watches.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the success and the sales of the Bambino, there are around 10
    version of this watch. If I had to choose one, my favorite one will be the
    one with the blue dial.
</p>

<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/affordable_watches/orient_bambino.jpeg" alt="Classic and elegant">
    <span class="caption text-muted">If you are starting with your collection, the Orient Bambino will be ideal as a dress watch </span>
</p>
<p>
    From the first glance you will be fascinated by the contrast of the dial of
    this Orient Bambino v4 fac08004d model. The dial is characterized by an
    ocean blue color in the central part that gradually intensifies until it
    reaches the edges, where it reaches a contrasting black.
</p>
<p>
    The strap is black and made of high-quality leather, a feature that makes
    it extremely comfortable and easy to wear.
</p>
<p>
    The diameter of the case is 42.5 mm, ideal for any type of wrist, both
    small and large, the case has a perfectly round shape that is very
    reminiscent of vintage watches.
</p>
<p>
    All bambino versions are water-resistant up to 30 meters. However, since it
    is a dress watch and because of the leather strap, swimming with it will
    not be recommendable.
</p>
<p>
    If you are looking for a classic watch, the best value for money out there
    may be the Bambino and one of their versions.

    2. Seiko Save the Ocean Series
</h2>
<p>
    Since we have introduced one Orient model, there is no doubt we would be
    also taking about Seiko. If we are presenting affordable and quality
    watches, there is no doubt that Seiko must be on the list. As it would be
    impossible to include the different models that could be included in this
    list, we have decided to include a limited edition of Seiko, which not be
    known to some.
</p>
<p>
    The new Seiko Prospex Save the Ocean are another example of how Seiko
    continues to dive deeper and deeper into its passion for underwater
    watchmaking, of which we have already seen some examples). Back in 2018, at
    Baselworld, the Japanese manufacturer announced Fabien Cousteau as the new
    ambassador, grandson of the legendary Jacques Cousteau, the French
    biologist and oceanographer who taught us to love the oceans.
</p>
<p>
    If you have realized about the name, you may guess that here we are talking
    about a watch related to the sea. When it comes to orology, this is of
    course related to diver watches, which also means that they are certified.
</p>

<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/affordable_watches/seiko_ocean.jpeg" alt="Ideal for Summer">
    <span class="caption text-muted">The Save the Ocean models are ideal for wearing on the beach (or pool)</span>
</p>
<p>
    There are so many unique models in this limited edition and for that reason
    it is not possible to focus on all of them. That’s why I will focus on my
    favorite version of this edition is the Seiko Save the Ocean Black Series.
    Since they a covered by black PVC, they have a more elegant look
</p>
<p>
    We have already said that there are different models, colors, and type of
    watches: Turtle, Samurai and these models will adapt to your wrist.
    Therefore, in this collection you will find multiple versatile options for
    your collection.

<h2>
    3. G-Shock GA-2100
</h2>
<p>
    We end our trip to Japan, with a low-cost but high-quality company producer
    Casio. In the 80s, a small team of engineers from Casio led by Ibe Kikuo
</p>
<p>
    started working a new project. Due to the fragility and delicacy of the
    watches at that time, their goal was to create an indestructible watch that
    would be valid for different occasions. One of them was the one related to
    those workers in the industry.
</p>
<p>
    With not very success at the start, mainly because the sales on the home
    country did not bring the attention of the Japanese, it started
    surprisingly to catch the eye of Americans and Europeans. It has now become
    one of the watches that almost every collector and part of a niche-market.
</p>

<p>
    Ever since, they have brought different breakthroughs to the watch
    industry. From solar energy to Bluetooth connectivity, it has always
    remained at the forefront of technology, design, and functionality,
    accompanying its evolution.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/affordable_watches/casioak.jpeg" alt="Future Classic">
    <span class="caption text-muted">The same that happened with other Casio models, there is no doubt that the GA-2100 will become a classic</span>
</p>
<p>
    G-Shock has created different iconic watches over the years. One of the most
    recent ones, Nicknamed the CasioOak for having a similar - but much more
    affordable - design (octogonal shape too) to the one of the Royal Oak from the Audemars Piguet,
    the G-Shock was an instant hit when it was released in 2020.
</p>
<p>
    The G-Shock GA-2100 is not as rough as other G-Shock models. It’s quite thin. For instance:
    example: at 11.8mm, it's the thinnest G-Shock currently makes. It's also a
    predominantly analog piece, with two hands and a physical day indicator. On
    the other hand, it also has a number of digital complications, including a
    timer, stopwatch, world time, calendar, and LED light. The most iconic
    version is the total black CasioOak, and that my seem that it is not easy
    to read, this is not true once you try it.
</p>
<p>
    In the past, one of the characteristics for which G-Shock had some
    detractors, is that their design was not the most sophisticated and elegant
    one. However, with the GA-2100, this is not an argument they may use. The
    GA-2100 model combines both elegance and robustness, making it an
    indestructible yet beautiful piece.

<h2>
    4. Tissot PRX
</h2>
<p>
    The decades of 70s and 80s were good decades for music lovers with special
    mention to disco music. In 1978, the first Superman was released in the
    cinemas and Argentina – without Maradona- won their first football world
    cup home. It was also in 1978 when the Swiss manufacturer Tissot released
    the PRX.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/affordable_watches/tissot.jpeg" alt="A Blast from the Past">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Tissot is making very interesting products in the last years and the PRX is probably the most relevant surprise</span>
</p>
<p>
    The PRX had an integrated steel bracelet, a barrel-shaped case which evoked
    a classic and clean design. In 2021, Tissot decided to reedit this model
    and generated very good reviews and good opinions.
</p>
<p>
    The name maybe a bit unknown for the users, but they are synonyms of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        P: Precise
    </li>
    <li>
        R: Robust
    </li>
    <li>
        X: It’s a reference to the water resistance of 10 (X) bars.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The reedition of this watch was an instant hit. It can be used as both
    dress or sports watch, and it also has some similarities with the Audemars
    Piguet Royal Oak or the Vacheron Constantin Overseas. Because of the good
    feedback, Tissot had also the idea of having new versions in 2022, like the
    chronographer, which is slightly bigger
</p>
<p>
    Either for a classic version or one of the latest versions, you will get a
    polyvalent and elegant watch that will not disappoint.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    <p>
        Together with fat and carbohydrates, proteins are part of the 3
        macronutrients that are essential for our body. In this article, we will
        analyze why they are so important for a healthy lifestyle and some examples
        of how to integrate them effortlessly into our meals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Proteins are built from amino acids and are the main components of all
        cells in the body. While human beings can produce some proteins internally,
        others must be obtained through the consumption of some aliments and foods.
    </p>
</div>
    <p>
        When you hear about diets, some people blame carbohydrates and fat, but
        never the third macronutrient. The reason is that our body is able to store
        fat and carbohydrates. However, it is not possible to store proteins.
        That’s why it’s important to keep a diet that is rich in protein (either
        protein or vegetable).
    </p>
    <p>
        Our body is not just composed of one unique protein, but we have many types
        that have a specific role. Some of these functions are related to
        transport, defense, or structure. Without going into detail, the first
        question you would be asking yourself is how you can get proteins and the
        ideal meals for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it comes to products, it’s likely that you may have heard about whey
        protein on more than one occasion. It is a product, which is made up as the
        main element of the proteins that are extracted from the whey of milk, and
        that can provide interesting benefits to our health. For this reason, it is
        widely used as a dietary supplement, especially indicated for practicing
        sports. However, having this product everyday – even with different flavors
        – may be a bit boring after several weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this simple reason, this article collects other products that may help
        in order to achieve a diversifying and funny diet, from complete natural
        products.
    </p>
<p class="big">
<hr class="bigHr">
</p>
    <h2>
        Quark
    </h2>
    <p>
        Quark is quite trendy recently in several countries and you may see with
        many flavors. Quark is a type of cheese obtained from the rennet of milk in
        which proteins are concentrated due to the fact that the largest aqueous
        portion or whey is separated from the milk after its acidification.
    </p>
    <p>
        Their protein content is variable, being able to find around 10 to 20% in
        them. One of the biggest advantages is that quark It is a source of casein,
        a protein of high biological value that our body can make the most of.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Greek yoghurt
    </h2>
    <p>
        Although the one you may find in your supermarket. may not have many things
        with the original Yoghurt from Greece, in both cases the content of
        proteins will give a boost to your daily intake.
    </p>
    <p>
        A 6-ounce serving of Greek yogurt provides you with 15 to 20 grams of
        protein, significant amounts of potassium, calcium, vitamin B-12 and B-6,
        and magnesium. It has low levels of sodium and cholesterol. Furthermore, it
        does not include too many carbohydrates, compared to the “normal” youghurt.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Skyr
    </h2>
    <p>
        Between cheese and yoghurt, we have the next product coming from a small
        island in the North. Skyr is a dairy product of Icelandic origin that has
        been gaining prominence for its health benefits. Although many classify it
        as a yogurt, it is actually a hybrid between it and a fresh cream cheese
        since its texture and flavor fall somewhere between the two.
    </p>
    <p>
        Skyr is usually made from skimmed milk, from which cream or cream has been
        removed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of this ancient historic process, Skyr is low in fat, but it keeps
        the milk, which is why it has big content on protein, vitamins, and
        minerals.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Eggs
    </h2>
    <p>
        Criticized by many not many years ago, eggs are one of the most common
        products. Apart from the big number of proteins, they are known for having
        a good quality due to the high proportion of amino acids.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, when it comes to combining them, eggs offer a multitude of
        gastronomic possibilities thanks to their versatility, easiness to prepare
        and technical properties. You can have them prepared in various ways such
        as fried, baked, boiled, or even used in some desserts. Obviously, if fried
        or in desserts (think of French eclairs or the Portuguese Molotof pudding
        or French eclairs), they will not be very healthy either. However, just a
        simple omelet (including also Spanish omelet) can be a good boost of
        proteins in your meals. If you add for example tuna, you will be almost
        covered for the day.
    </p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/proteins/eggs.jpg" alt="Versatile and Complete">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Very simple to cook (or part of more sophisticated recipes), eggs are one of the most complete sources of proteins</span>
</p>
    <h2>
        Cod
    </h2>
    <p>
        In general, all fish and meat have a high proportion of protein in their
        composition. Nonetheless, compared to other fish such as salmon, cod stands
        out above other varieties of fish, since it has a very low amount of fat,
        which is an advantage regarding the proportion of protein compared to the
        rest of the macronutrients.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite not being one of the most famous fish by the general public, the
        truth is that cod offers multiple options in the kitchen to satisfy all
        kinds of palates. In each country or region, you will see cooked in
        complete different ways.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Peanuts
    </h2>
    <p>
        Although surprising for some, nuts are two food groups that offer variable
        amounts of protein and can be very helpful in a vegetarian diet to meet the
        dietary needs of this macronutrient in the diet. Some examples are almonds
        or pistachios.
    </p>
    <p>
        This also happens with peanuts, a legume that, due to its appearance and
        form of consumption, is often confused with a nut. Peanuts offer
        interesting amounts of protein in the diet, whether consumed raw or with
        the classic peanut butter that many are passionate about. Here are some
        fantastic recipes with peanuts. One of the most popular ones is the peanut
        butter, which you can combine with many meals.
    </p>
    <p>
        The disadvantage is that they may be too caloric or contain too much salt,
        but just taking a bunch of them as a little snack will not harm anyone.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Oatmeal
    </h2>
    <p>
        Oatmeal is one of the most nutritious, versatile, and healthy cereals.
        Hence, more and more people are betting on incorporating it into their
        daily diet, mainly for breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oatmeal can boast of being one of the cereals with the highest protein
        content. We can obtain a protein of high biological value, in combination
        with foods such as milk or legumes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Its richness in protein (12 grams per 100 grams) and mostly complex
        carbohydrates (60 grams per 100), makes this cereal an ideal food for
        athletes. The disadvantage is that it may not be very tasty. For that
        reason, one solution is incorporating it into shakes.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Lupins
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you take care of your health, most of aforementioned products may be
        known to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        I never thought that the last one would be considered a high source of
        protein and it may be good for some of you to know. Lupins are similar to
        corn and eaten as snack. In some countries they may be more popular. They
        are legumes and are perfect to add proteins to vegetarian diets.
    </p>
    <p>
        It may not be very famous because it was always marginalized and linked to

        Nevertheless, their properties and some research about them have given them
        a more notorious role. The extraordinary properties of lupins have made
        this product popular, which is good news, since it is an inexpensive
        product, very healthy.

        Some of the most important attributes of this aliment is that they contain
        a high source of protein (they contain 40%). They are also. Ideal for
        diets. Its high fiber content (34%), low levels of fat (less than 6%) and
        antioxidants.

        Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
        We have seen different ways of having proteins in our daily diet. As we
        have seen, they have different advantages that will be beneficial for our
        health.
    </p>
    <p>
        They are effective for weight loss. Besides, proteins help the development
        of muscles and improves recovery, thereby contributing to the increase in
        their strength.
    </p>
    <p>
        reducing body fat while maintaining muscle, a goal that is often very
        difficult to achieve through exercise or diet alone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not just related to aesthetics or sport, beneficial health effects. Many
        studies have concluded that the supplement with Whey protein can be a great
        help to combat certain diseases and to have a better general state of
        health.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having said this, it’s now your turn to try the different options or even
        find new sources of protein. This also does not mean that you should forget
        about the other 2 macronutrients because they are also essential for a
        correct functioning of our body.

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    <p>
        While our life is easier compared to some years ago in many aspects, the
        first world has also led to new trends, problems, or even diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unknown or ignored in the past in the past, the importance of our mental
        health is taking the attention it deserves. We need to understand that
        there are few important things that our mind and body. Not taking care of
        it, may lead to several issues in our behavior, thinking or mood.
</div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Stress can be characterized as a response to any occasion which is seen,
        deliberately or unknowingly, as a danger to our safety or happiness. Stress
        which we experience as unmanageable can be detected as injury by our
        sensory system and become part of ourselves, damaging our body
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are some of my tricks to make sure that we fight back and defeat our
        worst fears and the general stress from our life.
    </p>
<p class="big">
<hr class="bigHr">
</p>
    <h3>
        1. HIIT
    </h3>
    <p>
        Low intensity training may be boring and will not cause much an impact once
        done. However, if we switch to high intensity interval training, in just
        20-minute sessions we will not just achieve more than in the low-paced
        session, but it will also help generate more hormones.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of these hormones involved in the process is cortisol. Cortisol is
        known to handle stress
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, if you are changing to go to the next level when it comes to
        your workout, this may also help reduce the stress.
    </p>
    <p>
        As with anything, everything in excess is bad. Therefore, too much workout
        will also not be the best option for de-stressing, because it will also
        have negative impact in our cortisol levels, being these too high.
    </p>
    <h3>
        2. Meditate
    </h3>
    <p>
        Meditation can provide you with a feeling of peace, harmony, and quietness.
        This process can help both your general wellbeing. You may use the
        mediation to relax and focus all the activity on fighting the stress. Not
        just that but being an expert on this technique can help you stay focused
        and keeping your inner peace. This means that, like sports, the benefits
        don’t end once you stop meditating, but in upcoming stressful environments
        and situations too.
    </p>
    <h3>
        3. Cook some pasta
    </h3>
    <p>
        When it comes to stress, it is also known that some people like cooking to
        disconnect from the world. Apart from that
    </p>
    <p>
        Eating complex carbohydrates may be not the best idea if you are trying to
        lose weight and cut additional calories. However, if you are stressed, why
        not having your favorite recipe of Your favorite Rigatoni Bolognese or
        spaghetti amatriciana after a nice workout session? It’s been
        scientifically proved that eating pasta can increase the serotonin levels,
        which amongst many tasks, it helps regulate anxiety, mood, and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, you should not abuse of too many carbs. When it comes to
        food, it must be important to say that ultra-processed food and sugar will
        have a negative impact. Therefore, it is also good to keep our diet as
        healthy as possible. It has a big impact in both our body and mental
        health.
    </p>
    <h3>
        4. Dress <strike>up</strike> down
    </h3>
    <p>
        Nature is not something in the environment, but it’s something that we can
        carry with ourselves. That’s why it’s important to choose the correct
        clothes when starting the day. For example, if you want to reduce
        eagerness, the best way after having your morning shower is selecting
        carefully natural clothes (linen, cotton, etc.) that will create a relaxed
        outfit. If you are stressed, dressing up with tight and elegant clothes may
        not be the best choice. Having a comfier garment on you will help you have
        a more easygoing lifestyle.
    </p>
    <h3>
        5. Explore nature
    </h3>
    <p>
        It’s said that people on villages are much happier than those living in big
        cities with all the traffic, pollution, and noise. It may be easier for
        some and more difficult for other. Nonetheless, one suggestion for those
        living in big cities is to try to escape for some days or do some
        excursions to the beach, lakes, or mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
        Especially these ones may be the best choice because researchers have
        proved that since air in high altitude is charged with negative ions (atoms
        that have lost electrons), these molecules help hikers relax and forget
        about their problems.
    </p>
    <h3>
        6. Sleep, Sleep &amp; Repeat
    </h3>
    <p>
        The function of sleeping has many processes behind that helps repair our
        brain and bodies. We all would like to have more time and we often tend to
        sacrifice our sleeping time in order to get many more things done in the
        day. However, with this are generating debt that we will pay the days
        after.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sleeping does not just make sure that we are more productive the day after,
        but it helps our whole body to recover and handle the stress accordingly
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s a vicious circle. Stress leads to insomnia and insomnia leads to more
        stress.
    </p>
    <h3>
        7. Switch it off
    </h3>
    <p>
        Having multiple devices with thousands of notifications per day is not the
        best way to stay focused and in good mood. Apart from the constant
        distractions, some of these messages and pop ups will create negative
        feelings (war, crisis, hunger, etc.) and increase the level of stress
        inside our bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
        For that reason, it is a good idea to keep the number of apps in our phone
        as reduced as possible and have some focus times defined in our day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another piece of advice is that once the workday or week are over, just
        toggle off the mailbox from your phone and hide the work laptop somewhere
        else. Even if it would seem that the world will collapse if you do so, try
        also to minimize the usage of your mobile phone to just those moments that
        really required.
    </p>
    <h3>
        8. Coffee
    </h3>
    <p>
        This one may be very obvious, but once we get into this habit is not easy
        to stop. We have discussed what the negative consequences of not sleeping
        are. The day after we need some energy, and the most accessible drug is a
        coffee shot. Since it seems to wake us up, we try one after another and
        some minutes later we are active, but our stress levels have also gone
        quite up. Cutting drastically coffee may be suicidal for some people.
        Therefore, a better idea may be to cut it progressively and replace it for
        healthier drinks such as green, matcha, black, and red tea. These infusions
        have great benefits when it comes to sleep quality, anxiety, and management
        of hormones
    </p>
    <h3>
        9. Eat more fruit
    </h3>
    <p>
        Either in solid state or in form of shakes and juices, fruit is very
        important and has a big impact on our bodies. Not just in our bodies or
        diet, fruits contain big amounts of different vitamins – for instance C and
        D-, that help us surpassing the stress threshold level. Therefore, these
        products can be a good booster to our anti-stress protection.
    </p>
    <p>
        If for some reason, you think you will not reach the needed vitamin levels,
        having some supplements will also help us achieve our goals.
    </p>
    <h3>
        10. Breathing Exercises
    </h3>
    <p>
        This one can be a technique that is used just when we are about to blow up or collapse.
        The trick in those tense situations is to handle our breathing in a good,
        consistent way with an efficient technique.
    </p>
    <p>
        You need to be as comfortable as you can and try to evade your mind and
        focus just on controlling your breathing. For example, put attention to the
        effect of inspiring through the nose and expiring through the moth.
        Counting the process will also help if you want to focus just on this
        activity as much as you can.
    </p>
    <h3>
        11. Spend time with animals
    </h3>
    <p>
        As with nature, spending time with animals will let us avoid our current
        work and responsibilities, with a more easygoing approach to life. The make
        us more aware of what the important aspects of life are.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, it has been confirmed that being in contact with animals such
        as dogs or cats activate the oxytocin hormone, which regulates the stress
        and comfort.
    </p>
    <h3>
        12. Read a novel
    </h3>
    <p>
        When there are many topics going through your mind, what I do is just
        trying to disconnect and focusing on only single topic. The easiest way to
        do so is taking the favorite book from the shelf or your book eReader.
        Although it is said that music may be a better way to disconnect it has
        been demonstrated with multiple researchs that reading a science or
        adventure story helps us totally disconnect from our daily tasks immersing
        ourselves in the story. In any case, you can leave the music for your HIIT
        session.
    </p>
    <h3>
        13. Switch on the PS4
    </h3>
    <p>
        In the case a book is not enough for you to evade the reality and manage
        the anxiety, a more active solution would be going to your computer or vide
        console and playing an adventure or any other type of game.
    </p>
    <p>
        As it occurs when reading, videogames help us distract ourselves with the
        preferred games. Videogames are engaging, fun and at the same time they are
        somehow challenging, getting some rewards. At the same time, as eating
        pasta, they increase our serotonin levels, having a positive impact on our
        well-being and mood.
    </p>
    <h3>
        14. Massage session
    </h3>
    <p>
        Massages can be a great complement to an exercise and apart from the
        muscular regeneration benefits, they also have benefits when it comes to
        anti-stress techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
        They help reduce the heart rate, blood pressure and overall improving our
        sleep quality and mental health, giving a boost to our well-being. Having
        just a 15–30-minute session can be a shot of good emotions and feelings.
    </p>
    <h3>
        15. Clean your body
    </h3>
    <p>
        To conclude the list, cleaning your body and face might me a good activity
        to increase our mood and relaxation levels. You may start exfoliating your
        face, continuing with a long bath with bath salts and candles and putting a
        face or ice will probably the best idea after a stressful working day.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the whole process you will leave the bathroom totally rejuvenated –
        and not just for your skin -.

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    If you have been in the crypto or blockchain scene for some time, you may
    be familiar with the different layers of the blockchain, their functions,
    and how they interact one with another. However, if you are new, you may
    hear terms such as L1 or L2 and you may ask yourself what these words are.
    Don’t worry about this.
</div>
<p>
    In this article we explain not just the different layers but also the
    importance of each of it. It’s also important to note what they mean and
    why some tokens may be correlated because they are part of the same layer.
</p>
<p>
    As it occurs with the OSI and the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) models, we
    also have different layers in blockchains.
    The different OSI layers are: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport,
    Session, Presentation, and Application.
    The ones of the Interest Protocol are just 4: Link, Internet, Transport,
    Application. A similar structure occurs in the Blockchains.
</p>
<p>
    We can distinguish 4 different Blockchain layers, where each one has a
    specific purpose. Each layer is essential and has some defined functions
    and roles. They start with Layer 0 and the last one is Layer 3. In order to
    see the different features, it’s better to see this with some examples.
</p>
<p class="big">
<hr class="bigHr">
</p>
<h2>
    Layer 0
</h2>
<p>
    This protocol is where everything starts and the bottom of the different
    blockchain protocols that we see later. It’s like the foundations of the
    building where the different infrastructure, hardware and internet are
    provided. Although, the other layers would be useless without this initial
    layer, it’s also the layer that cannot be seen and sometimes ignored.
</p>
<p>
    They allow interconnectivity and integration between traditional and
    blockchain network.
</p>
<p>
    As mentioned, this is where everything starts. Therefore, they allow other
    blockchains be built upon them and also that different blockchains are
    operable between them. In other words, the chains that are created on the
    layers above are interoperable and compatible thanks to the L0 protocols.
</p>
<p>
    For these characteristics they can be seen as the data transfer layer of
    the OSI model. Without this one, Bitcoin or Ethereum would not be able to
    run. Basically, their objective is to interconnect different chains between
    L1 protocols.

            <h5>PolkaDot: Web3.0 Interoperability</h5>
            <small> The most famous example is probably PolkaDot. The goal of the protocol is
                like the one of a bridge between different L1 blockchains. It allows cross-blockchain transfers of any
                sort of data or asset, not just
                tokens. Connecting to Polkadot offers users the potential to interoperate
                with a wide form of blockchains in the Polkadot network.<br>

<h2>
    Layer 1
</h2>
<p>
    Layer 1 blockchains are probably the most famous ones for most of us. They
    are also known as public chains because they have their own structure,
    encryption, algorithms, technology and mechanisms. These are blockchains
    that are used to process transactions on their own blockchain and have
    different utilities.
</p>
<p>
    This protocol consists of the following sublayers: Data layer, Network
    layer, Consensus layer and Activating layer
</p>
<p>
    Since the transactions need to be processed and validated, the famous
    Consensus Mechanism (PoW, PoS, etc.) is also inherent to this layer.
    However, there are also other technical aspects involved such as the block
    time, the different rules and the dispute resolution. In this layer, we
    also see different limitations such as scaling.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="/img/posts/blockchain_layers/algorand.png" alt="Sustainable and scalable">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Algorand is probably one of the most sustainable blockchain due to the technology and consensus mechanism</span>
</p>
<p>
    The goal of Layer 1 blockchains is to achieve the following 3
    characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Decentralization
    </li>
    <li>
        Security
    </li>
    <li>
        Scalability
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There is a famous term called the Blockchain Trilemma, which says basically
    that basic chains can just achieve 2 out of 3.
</p>
<p>
    In order to achieve the first 2, scalability is sacrificed and left for
    later. It’s here where Layer 2 plays a key role too.
</p>
<p>
    Probably these blockchains are the most famous ones to you. Bitcoin,
    Ethereum, Cardano or Solana are examples of this category and most
    probably.

            <h5>L1 Example</h5>
            <h5>Algorand: Offsetting the Carbon Footprint</h5>
            <small> As opposed to Ethereum, Algorand is a L1 chain, without needing L2
                protocols for scability purposes. This is because the consensus mechanism
                in the Algorand Network is quite different. In this case, a group of
                validators is selected randomly each time, without needing to have the
                majority. Algorand is also known as the Green Blockchain.<br>

</h2>
<p>
    In L1 blockchains, we have seen the Blockchain Trilemma and the problem
    with scalability. Apart from the Blockchain Trilemma Bitcoin and Ethereum
    are getting older and what was valid some years ago it is no longer enough,
    mainly with the increasing number of users. .For example, we have several
    problems in terms of scalability, speed and gas fees. For that reason, the
    purpose of L2 blockchains is to enhance the L1 blockchains, with several
    updates and applications. Via this layer, the processing of the different
    transactions is also increased. This layer is seen as an auxiliary
    extension of the L1 protocol .
</p>
<p>
    For example, Ethereum is only able to process around 10 transactions per
    second. Ethereum is famous for many benefits, but one of the disadvantages
    is the gas fees. When the network is congested, there is a lot of
    competition to process the different transactions and it’s when the gas
    fees considerably increase – the law of supply and demand -. This problem
    is becoming more often because of the adoption of Ethereum and the
    applications within the ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
    What the L2 protocol does is to free up Ethereum (L1) from this work. This
    way, they can process thousands of transactions per second. Ethereum is the
    layer with more L2 protocols.
</p>
<p>
    Ethereum is famous for having many L2 solutions, but it also applies to
    other L1 layers such as Bitcoin.There are some examples for Etherum:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Polygon is one example running on top of Ethereum. The goal of the
        Indian platform is to connect blockchains built on Ethereum.
    </li>
    <li>
        Optimism is also developed for Ethereum in order to improve speed and
        reduce fees in the Ethereum network
    </li>
    <li>
        Immutable X is the second layer protocol used in the NFT Marketplace
        OpenSea (built on ERC-721), that helps also reduce fees when
        transacting in the blockchain.
    </li>
</ul>

            <h5>Lightning Network</h5>
            <small>For the most famous chain, the Lightning Network is a L2 payment protocol layered on top
                of Bitcoin. It permits fast transactions among participating nodes and has
                been proposed as an approach to the bitcoin scalability trouble.<br>

<h2>
    Layer 3
</h2>
<p>
    We have seen that L1 and L2 layers are quite linked to each one, but there
    are many differences between the different blockchains in these layers. The
    reason is that they use completely different technologies and processes.
    The purpose of the third layer is to abstract these differences and make
    the things much easier for the user. With this, the different ecosystems
    are interconnectable and can communicate regardless of the technical
    differences that we can find among them
</p>
<p>
    This is something similar to what’s done in the IP Internet Protocol and
    the application layer. L3 is the protocol that hosts the DApps. These
    applications are related to diverse topics such as DeFi, games, or storage
    apps.
</p>
<p>
    Although Bitcoin is the most known one here, Ethereum is the one that has
    more applications and has a huge ecosystem. The different cases vary across
    sectors:
</p>
<p>
    Ethereum aside, Solana is also famous for having many consolidated
    applications.
</p>
<p>
<h3>
    Examples of dApps
</h3>
<p>
    In order to understand the last layer, these are some examples of complete different applications accessible to
    users.
</p>
</p>
<h4>
    1. Uniswap (v2 and v3)
</h4>
<p>
    <a href="https://uniswap.org/">
        Uniswap</a> is one of the largest DEXs in the space and is powered by the Ethereum
    blockchain. One of the main differences compared to Binance or Coinbase is
    that Uniswap operates without an order book. Instead, it uses framework to
    provide trading liquidity.
</p>
<h4>
    2. OpenSea
</h4>
<p>
    <a href="https://opensea.io/">
        OpenSea</a> is the world’s largest Non-Fungible Token marketplace which is
    based on Ethereum ERC-721. In this platform all users can buy, sell, or exchange different items, such as collectibles, gaming articles and other type of goods.

</p>
<h4>
    3. Orca
</h4>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.orca.so/">
        Orca</a> is the first user-friendly cryptocurrency exchange built on Solana. It
    offers minimal fees and latency compared to Ethereum. There, users can exchange tokens with minimal transaction fees
    and lower latency than any decentralized exchange on Ethereum. Apart from that, users
    can provide liquidity to a trading pool to earn a share of trading fees.
</p>
<h4>
    4. PancakeSwap
</h4>
<p>
    <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/">
        PancakeSwap</a> an be seen as an alternative to UniSwap.
    As this one, is a decentralized exchange, which allows for
    trading cryptocurrencies and tokens without an intermediary, and runs on
    Binance Smart Chain. It is built on an automated market maker system, which
    relies on liquidity pools between token pairs to enable crypto trades.

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    You have been probably hearing the term DAO for some time, but some topics may
    not be clear yet to you. A DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous
    Organization. In other words, it is an organization that is controlled
    by algorithms or smart contracts, it is not bound by any particular law
    since it is controlled by a blockchain and smart contracts. In other
    words, what it is looking for is to get rid of intermediaries, just as
    bitcoin did when it was created more than 10 years ago. The purpose of
    a DAO is also the one for a company or an institution to be able to
    function without hierarchical management.
</div>
<p>
    To give you an example, bitcoin can be considered a primitive DAO,
    since it works with a series of given rules, is autonomous, and is
    managed in a decentralized way following a consensus protocol.
    Although, the use of Smart contracts, typical of DAOs, did not reach
    the Ethereum platform, which allowed their creation, and has given them
    their current structure.
</p>
<p>
    Initially, Bitcoin was considered the first fully functional DAO, as it
    has a set of pre-programmed rules, works autonomously, and is
    coordinated through a distributed consensus protocol. Since then, the
    use of smart contracts and dApps has been made possible by the Ethereum
    platform, which has brought the creation of DAOs closer to the general
    public and shaped their current look.
</p>
<p class="big">
<hr class="bigHr">
</p>
<h2>
    How it works
</h2>
<p>
    The launch of development of a DAO is composed of 3 different steps easy to understand. This is how DAOs work and the distinct phases before it becomes totally decentralized.
</p>
<h3>
    First phase
</h3>
<p>
    The first phase is setting the rules according to which it will work.
    Those rules are codes as a smart contract, existing autonomously on the
    Internet, but at the same time requiring developers to perform some
    specific tasks.
</p>
<h3>
    Second phase
</h3>
<p>
    Once the rules are established, the next phase is the financing phase.
    This is a very important milestone part for two reasons. First of all,
    a DAO has to have some kind of internal property. In this case, these
    are tokens that can be spent by the organization or used to reward
    certain activities within it.
</p>
<p>
    Second, by investing in a DAO, users gain voting rights, as if they
    owned the shares of a company. Consequently, you can give your opinion
    and take part in the decisions of the DAO.
</p>
<h3>
    Third phase
</h3>
<p>
    Once the funding period ends and a DAO is deployed, it becomes a fully
    autonomous body and completely independent from its creators, as well
    as from anyone else. They are open-source, which means their code can
    be viewed by anyone. Also, all financial rules and transactions are
    recorded on the blockchain. This makes DAOs transparent, immutable, and
    incorruptible.
</p>
<p>
    Once the DAO is up and running, all decisions about where and how to
    spend your funds are made by consensus. Everyone who bought a stake in
    a DAO can make proposals about its future. To prevent the network from
    being spammed with proposals, a monetary deposit may be required to
    submit such a proposal.
</p>
<p>
    Subsequently, the interested parties vote on the proposal. To perform
    any action, the majority needs to agree to do it. The percentage
    required to reach that majority may vary depending on each DAO, as may
    be specified in its code.
</p>
<p>
    Essentially, DAOs allow people to exchange their funds with anyone in
    the world. This can be done in the form of an investment, a charitable
    donation, fundraisers, loans, etc. all without a middleman. One
    potentially important problem with the voting system is that even if a
    security hole was detected in early code, it cannot be fixed until the
    majority votes on it. While the vote is taking place, such hackers can
    exploit a bug in the code.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/dao/dao_types.jpg" alt="Diversity of DAOs">
    <span class="caption text-muted">There are diverse DAO categories and more and more DAOs created in those</span>
</p>
<p class="big">
<hr class="bigHr">
</p>
<h2>
    How to invest
</h2>
<p>
    Investing in a DAO is relatively easy, especially if we know have
    experience buying other cryptocurrencies and we already have a wallet
    to store the coins. All we really need to do is buy tokens of a
    particular DAO. As described before, buying tokens would be the
    equivalent of buying shares of Amazon, Apple, or Microsoft. In some
    cases, there are dedicated channels like Discord where some interesting
    information is shared.
</p>
<p>
    Once the financing phase is over, we will be able to make proposals,
    vote on them and even obtain benefits. The number of tokens purchased
    will correlate to the amount of voting power we will get within the
    DAO.
</p>
<p>
    However, before investing, we must be sure about the project to know
    exactly what we are getting into. DAOs are completely transparent and
    their underlying code is always open source, which means that only we
    have the opportunity to review the code to make sure there are no bugs
    in it.
</p>
<p>
    It is undeniable that the very concept of DAOs is extremely exciting as
    it strives to solve everything that is wrong with the way modern
    organizations are managed. A perfectly structured DAO gives each
    investor the opportunity to shape the organization. There is no
    hierarchical structure, which means that each innovative idea can be
    submitted by anyone and considered by the entire organization. With a
    set of pre-written rules that every investor knows before joining the
    organization, as well as the voting system, they leave no room for
    discussion.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, since both submitting a proposal and voting in favor of it
    require the investor to spend a certain amount of money, it pushes him
    to evaluate his decisions and not waste time on ineffective solutions.
    Finally, as all the rules, as well as each of the financial
    transactions, are registered in the Blockchain, available for review by
    anyone, the DAOs are completely transparent. Everyone who participates
    helps decide how to spend the funds and can track how those funds are
    spent.
</p>

<h2>
     Examples
</h2>
<p>
    Depending on the purpose, there are several types of DAOs. Some of them
    are the following ones:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Investment DAOs
    </li>
    <li>
        Collector DAOs
    </li>
    <li>
        Entertainment DAOs
    </li>
    <li>
        Grant DAOs
    </li>
    <li>
        Protocol DAOS
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In this article, we will focus on some names related to different DAO
    categories, with no preferential order.
</p>
<h3>
    1. Maker DAO
</h3>
<p>
    This is probably one of the most famous DAO out there. We have seen
    that with DeFi, we can reach the democratization of finance and we can
    make many products available to almost everyone around the world
</p>
<p>
    MakerDao, not to be confused with DAO Maker, has world’s first unbiased
    currency, Dai, which is a Maker Dao’s star product. DAI is a stable,
    decentralized currency that does not discriminate. Any individual or
    business can take benefit from the advantages of digital money.
</p>
<p>
    Dai is a stable coin, hence there is no volatility and for that reason,
    it is used in different financing projects. With this coin, you can
    exchange your assets for Dai and use this money in various aspects of
    finance.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding governance, a community of MKR token holders governs the
    Maker Protocol, the smart contracts that power the stable coin Dai.
</p>
<p>
    Over 400 apps and services such as wallets, DeFi platforms, or games
    have integrated Dai as an allowed payment method.

<h3>
    2. KlimaDAO
</h3>
<p>
    With the importance of climate change and small reactivity from some
    governments and companies, it is time that we do something about it.
    While our actions may not have had much positive impact in the past. we
    can start pushing for a change with KlimaDao
</p>
<p>
    With KlimaDAO, users can make a better more sustainable and greener
    world, by fighting against climate change. Via this mechanism, owners
    of this token can earn rewards with the KLIMA token. KLIMA is a digital
    currency backed by real carbon assets.
</p>
<p>
    They have started a decentralized and open market for carbon. Besides,
    the KLIMA token incentivizes investors, citizens, and organizations to
    participate in and govern this new economy.
</p>
<p>
    By increasing access and demand for carbon offsets, KlimaDAO makes
    pro-climate projects more profitable. At the same time, this process
    forces companies to adapt faster to climate change.

<h3>
    3. Olympus DAO
</h3>
<p>
    With all the central banks printing money and excessive Quantitative
    Easing, these actions have led to many negative consequences. For
    example, it has caused the devaluation of our currencies and assets in
    most countries.
</p>
<p>
    Olympus is building a community-owned, decentralized, and
    censorship-resistant reserve currency that is deeply liquid,
    asset-backed, and used widely. The name of this currency is OHM.
</p>
<p>
    With the rise of decentralized finance and economy, these concepts will
    also need a decentralized reserve currency. In other words, we need a
    currency that is not pegged to any central bank or fiat system
</p>
<p>
    Via this, Olympus DAO’s goal is to build a stable but independent
    currency that achieves purchasing power, broad acceptance, and high
    utility for all users.

    formidable participants whose purpose is to very own an NBA crew
    describes the underlying mission of DAOs in its purest form:
</p>
<p>
    They will permit our contributors to take part in selections affecting
    the running approaches of a National Basketball Association (NBA) crew
    along with however now not restrained to a standard control, ticketing,
    merchandising, and partnership.
</p>
<p>
    This means that you can be the owner of an NBA team without being Mark
    Cuban or Steve Ballmer. Imagine signing the next free agent or picking
    your favorite prospect in the NBA draft? This will be soon possible.

<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    DAOs and crypto in general have brought different benefits to users.
    Some of them are access, costs, or transparency. We are happy about the
    fact that are more opportunities that focus on our goals and that via
    pooling individuals with the same objectives we can achieve our desired
    goal. At the same time, there is also criticism related to the level of
    experience the members may have. The comment is that as opposed to
    traditional organizations, where a specific number of experience people
    (e.g. board of directors) make the decisions, granting all members of a
    DAO the power to make any change may not be the best generating the
    best results for these autonomous organizations in the long-term.
</p>
<p>
    However, what is certain is that DAOs have created disruption and could
    shake in the long-term the current organization design and how the
    interactions within these.
</p>

    Although there has been an increase in the number of DAOs, we will see
    many more interesting in the next years. In case you would like to
    investigate further, please note that the code of these DAOs is

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    If you are already up to date with concepts such as the ones of blockchain,
    DeFi, or metaverse, now is the time to find out about Web3. This term has
    gained traction in 2021 and 2022 and continues to be mentioned in articles
    that discuss about topics such NFTs, cryptocurrencies, or decentralized
    finance. However, Web3 (or Web 3.0) is far more than that as you will see
    below.
</div>
<p>
    On top of the latest trends and news, I see more ads, courses and job
    offers related to Web3. That is related to the growth and how the corporate
    world can benefit from this generation.
</p>
<p>
    Web3 is the third generation of Internet services for web site and
    applications. This concept focuses on the use of machine-based data
    understanding to provide a semantic and data-centric Web. The final goal of
    Web3 is to create smarter, more connected, and more open websites. Not just
    that, but the goal of Web3, as we will see later, is also to give back the
    prominence to the users.
</p>
<p>
    Web3 is not implemented yet, so there is no clear definition about various
    aspects yet. To give you an idea, making the transition from the original
    web, from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, took more than one decade. Nowadays, we are
    still working with Web 2.0 and there may be still years to come until we
    see the full capabilities of Web3.
</p>
<p class="big">
<hr class="bigHr">
</p>
<h2>
    History of the Internet
</h2>
<p>
    To give you some history about the internet, we can see that each topic for
    each of the Web version:
</p>
<h3>
    Web 1.0
</h3>
<p>
    If the early web, called 1.0, everything worked around hyperlinks. Web 1.0,
    also known as the World Wide Web, appeared first. Some of us will remember
    those days when connecting to the Internet was a still a slow process and
    there were still not many options yet.
</p>
<h3>
    Web 2.0
</h3>
<p>
    Next, we have Web2.0. This one was around social networks. This is the term you have been hearing in the last years with the boom of Facebook, Twitter and other companies.
</p>
<p>
    As more people began to use the Internet, the potential it had was
    understood globally. For this reason, new infrastructures were created to
    promote it. The Internet became faster and allowed for heavier applications
    and websites, which gave rise to the era of social networks and huge
    platforms such as Netflix, YouTube, Facebook, or Amazon.
</p>
<p>
    Today, people from all over the world can share information and be
    entertained, shop, find answers to their questions and interact with each
    other thanks to Web 2.0.
</p>
<h3>
    Web3
</h3>
<p>
    The last generation, Web 3.0, is based on tokens, the digital units of
    exchange for blockchain technologies.
</p>
<p>
    There are already some Web3 examples. On one hand, we have Apple's Siri,
    which
    <strong>
        uses voice recognition techniques and artificial intelligence to bring
        results and perform actions
    </strong>
    . To give us an idea of the improvement that this entails, Webs 1.0 and 2.0
    carry out word-by-word matches of the text in relation to what is published
    on the network. This often brings with it an information bias.
</p>
<p>
    Web3 systems, however, seek contextualized knowledge to help people in
    their searches, pointing to a series of analyses and potentially useful
    information. One of the distinctions of the Web 3.0 search engine is the
    time the user needs to spend navigating through a universe of data to find
    what they really want resolved.
</p>
<p>
    Companies like Amazon, Apple and IBM have been investing heavily in Web 3.0
    technologies. For example, Google Inc. over the last decade has made
    several acquisitions of companies in the Semantic Web area, such as Applied
    Semantics and Metaweb Technologies, Inc, among others.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, not everything will take so long to arrive to our daily
    lives. There are some technologies that will define this new web that are
    already being developed. For example, smart home and home automation
    applications using wireless networks and IoT are examples of how Web3 is
    already impacting technology.
</p>
<p>
    If we go to existing devices: Apple's Siri or Amazon’s Alexa are examples
    of Web3 since they combine artificial intelligence with voice recognition.
    This network is still developing and there is still a long way to go.
    Another important player in Web3 is the Brave Browser and some interesting
    reward mechanisms such as BAT tokens.

</p>
<p class="big">
<hr class="bigHr">
</p>
<h2>
    Characteristics of Web3
</h2>
<p>
    First, Web 3.0 will be primarily data centric. This data is endless and for
    that reason it is necessary to design an appropriate storage architecture
    and technology. Although Big Data seems to be the way to go, there is still
    research to be done on the most effective use of technology to store and
    manage this data, as privacy issues could arise in the future too.
</p>
<h4>
    Tokenization
</h4>
<p>
    This new web model has many services based on the token economy, so that
    the ownership and control of these services would be distributed among the
    owners of the tokens, who are also users. The tokens, as we know, have
    exchange value, so this means that users can collect these tokens whenever
    they want. Therefore, Web3 and DeFi may also come hand in hand.
</p>
<p>
    What it does seem is that Web 3.0 will be primarily data centric. This data
    is infinite and therefore it is necessary to design an appropriate storage
    architecture and technology. Although Big Data seems to be the way to go,
    there is still a lot of research to be done on the most effective use of
    technology to store data, as privacy issues could arise.
</p>
<h4>
    Robustness
</h4>
<p>
    This network will give creators and users more freedom in general. It will
    ensure that the latter always have control over their online data by using
    decentralized networks. The next version of the Internet is also expected
    to be more reliable given its decentralized nature, which eliminates the
    possibility of a single point of failure
</p>
<h4>
    Democratization
</h4>
<p>
    It does not need to be controlled by a single entity. The largest companies
    may no longer have full control over the Internet. As a result,
    decentralized applications or apps cannot be censored or restricted in any
    way.
</p>
<p>
    What is going on now with Web 2.0 is that users create but it is the
    technology companies that monetize this content
</p>
<h4>
    Customization
</h4>
<p>
    We will also be able to personalize our browsing experience because this
    type of website will be able to understand our preferences and tastes. This
    will also allow us to navigate more productively, focusing on what we are
    really interested in.
</p>
<h4>
    Commerce
</h4>
<p>
    The same way Web3 will help users, this version will also help businesses,
    and this will cause eCommerce to continue growing. Sellers will better
    understand our purchasing needs and will show us those products and
    services that we are interested in buying with the help of artificial
    intelligence. This will allow us to see better, more relevant ads that are
    more likely to be beneficial to us.
</p>
<h4>
    Better connectivity
</h4>
<p>
    In the past years, we have seen cases that because of interruptions in the
    service, we have lost access to some sites or services for hours.
</p>
<p>
    Since the data will be stored in distributed databases by decentralization,
    users will not have to worry about service interruptions or account
    suspensions for technical reasons.
</p>
<h4>
    Decentralization
</h4>
<p>
    As we have commented in the previous point, one of the key characteristics
    of web 3.0 is decentralization. In this new version, the data will be
    connected in a decentralized way, unlike 2.0, in which it is mainly stored
    in centralized places. Therefore, the data will not be kept in the
    datacentres of big corporations anymore.
</p>
<p>
    We saw with the explosion of web 2.0 brings social networks and
    interactivity with the user, which creates most of its content. It is the
    era of companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, creating silo,
    centralized services dependent on these corporations.
</p>
<h2>
    The role of corporations
</h2>
<p>
    The impact of Web 3.0 on companies will take place in different ways. In
    some cases,    <strong>it will make them highly user-centric and more transparent</strong>
    . Everything that was wrong in terms of user data will undergo a radical
    transformation.
</p>
<p>
    Traditional and new businesses alike will welcome Blockchain technology and
    all the possibilities it brings. You will see that your applications will
    receive blockchain updates in which everything will be made public and
    accessible.
</p>
<p>
    Web 3.0 will bring about a major change in how the Internet works by
    focusing on user privacy. In fact, this is a problem that has been
    discussed for a long time but has not been effectively solved.
</p>
<p>
    Web3 uses blockchain technology, unlike Web 2.0, which takes advantage of
    the Internet to develop applications. It is technically safer to store
    customer data on a blockchain as it is decentralized and its use by
    businesses is transparent, thus protecting it from hackers. Some experts
    say the transfer of data ownership to consumers could disrupt the
    technology sector. And this is because many technology companies would lose
    access to the data that has given them a competitive advantage until now.
</p>
<p>
    Also, thanks to blockchain technology, visitors to a website will have a
    more pleasant login experience. Think how many times you have logged into
    websites using your Facebook profile. Blockchain technology employs the
    same principle as Facebook, which already owns the user's information.
    However,
    <strong>
        by using Blockchain, you will be the sole owner of your information.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>

</p>
<h2>
    What's next?
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>To sump up, in Web</strong>
    <strong>3</strong>
    <strong>
        , users will also be able to interact with data thanks to the use of
        artificial intelligence and machine learning technology.
    </strong>
    That is, it will combine the concepts of the Semantic Web with AI.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, the use of artificial intelligence will allow data much
    faster to users and that these data will be more relevant and personified.
    We are starting to see the use of this technology on the Internet
    <strong>
        through algorithms that are used to suggest products or videos to users
        based on their previous searches
    </strong>
    .
</p>
<p>
    However, this will be even more advanced, and we have still to see a wide
    range of new possibilities in the upcoming years.
</p>
<p>
    We could say that with Web3 we come back to where the Internet started and
    the original idea: a decentralized internet, where there is no control from
    central authorities and the power is given back to the users and consumers.
    However, the full potential of Web3 is still to be seen.

    Introduction
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    Some weeks ago, we introduced some investment funds or ETFs focusing on
    specific countries or indexes such as the S&amp;P500 or the Nasdaq. We also
    went further and analyzed some interesting regions with a considerable
    expected growth for the following years.
</div>
<p>
    I have also said that I prefer to focus on these broad investment vehicles
    in order to get the best possible returns with the lowest possible risk,
    due to the diversification that these products offer.
</p>
<p>
    However, this approach may be boring, and we can always allocate some of
    our savings to have some fun, either in the way of cherry picking some
    stocks or in this case with some niche sectors. The idea on selecting these
    specific areas for the ETF, is because we think that there will be a huge
    growth in these sectors in the upcoming years (or in the short-term).
    Depending on our strategy, they help us combine our defensive and
    aggressive options in our portfolio.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the price of a security is composed of the current
    earnings and the estimated growth. This also means that for sectors with a
    high growth, the current price already reflects it.
</p>
<p>
    In any case, these are some of the industries that will create a
    considerable impact in the years to come, and for that reason it may be
    worth to have some of our portfolio destined to any of these sectors.
</p>
<p class="big">

</p>
<h2>
    1. Videogames
</h2>
<p>
    When I was young, the video games sector was already important, but it was
    below the movies or the music industry. Today, this industry’s revenue is
    bigger than the one of these two industries combined. The growth has been
    incredible in the last 15 years, but it will for sure not stop there.
</p>
<p>
    While some years ago, most games could not be played online, this activity
    has also changed in the last years, opening new possibilities. For example,
    we have also seen this with the different organizations supporting and
    investing in eSports. New ways of entertainment have been included, giving
    more importance to social or mobile games.
</p>
<p>
    The latest trends such as NFT or the metaverse have also an important role
    on some of these games and the different unique items that the players may
    get. In some cases, the trends could change completely the way we game.
    Therefore, if the growth in the last decade was already impressive, these
    two blockchain phenomenon will help to push the videogames even further.

        2. Artificial Intelligence
    </h2>
    <p>
        The advance of Artificial Intelligence is unstoppable, as organizations
        are adopting different branches of this technology to boost their
        digital transformation, giving great strength to a market that
        encompasses AI software, hardware, and services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, the application fields of AI range from finance to robot
        control, from image recognition to vehicle driving and much more. We
        can see that big players like Google, Apple, Intel, Amazon, IBM are
        investing massively in the development of this sector. Not long ago,
        Google bough the company DeepMind for $400 million.
    </p>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that seeks
        to bring technology to mimic human behavior. Theorizing of a computer
        mind that mimics the functioning of the human goes back more than half
        a century, in 1956, when the term Artificial Intelligence was
        introduced as part of the Dartmouth Summer Research project.
    </p>
    <p>
        The shift from theory to practice came hand in hand with the rise of
        computer skills. The technological acceleration of recent years has
        allowed the development of increasingly sophisticated and powerful
        algorithms. Today, the application fields of AI range from finance to
        robot control, from image recognition to vehicle driving and much more.
        Big conglomerates like Google, Apple, Intel, Amazon, IBM are investing
        massively in the development of this sector.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to some sources, sales in the next eight years may grow by up
        to 35,570 million dollars, or what is the same, an increase capacity of
        more than 600%. In addition to this astonishing information, investment
        in AI is increasing at a rate of 37% per year and by 2022 it will
        exceed 77 billion dollars, three times more than the current 24
        billion.

        3. eCommerce
    </h2>
    <p>
        Although eCommerce had been growing steadily for years, COVID-19 was
        the trigger that changed in many cases how we buy different products
        and articles, and in general the shopping experience. Due to the loosen
        restrictions in most countries, the growth has been normalized in 2021,
        but predictions say that eCommerce will be growing every year. Indeed,
        the pandemic helped some people discover that buying could be much
        easier and without any issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some factors helping the growth will be related to mobile phones and
        faster technologies such as 5G. More services such as augmented
        reality, virtual reality, image recognition or artificial intelligence
        will be possible to offer a broader range of possibilities to the
        customer. Besides, almost every company today has an online application
        and from there the user can buy directly almost anything.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, the rise of more payment options such as of
        cryptocurrencies will also be an added benefit to customers wanting to
        buy online.
    </p>
    <p>
        While more senior people were initially reluctant to online shopping,
        younger generations such as the millennials are the early adaptors of
        this trend. This means that this way of buying will be already
        inculcated for the new generations to come and will be seen as
        something completely normal in the everyday life of every customer in a
        few years from now.

    <h2>
        4. Cannabis
    </h2>
    <p>
        This is a controversial topic in some cases, but the truth is that more
        and more countries are allowing the usage of marijuana for therapeutic
        treatments. I have said that it is a polemic aspect because Cannabis
        has been seen as a criminal or something that should be avoided until
        recently. Although, we need more education on this topic, mainly for
        younger generations. it has been proved that the Marijuana derivative
        medicaments or therapies have multiples benefits in diseases.
        Furthermore, the price of this medication is generally lower compared
        to other alternatives, and it also has less side effects.
    </p>
    <p>
        The US and Canada have been two of the latest countries that have
        approved the usage of Marijuana, and as many things occur, some other
        regions such as Europe or Asia may also follow soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is expected to grow between 2022 and 2030 with an annualized rate of
        25%. Apart from the medical advances, the decriminalization has also an
        important role in this rise.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two factors that will be key for the expansion of the
        Cannabis sector:
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of regulation, it is predicted that more and more countries
        will allow medical treatment with Marijuana or derivatives from this
        drug.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another key aspect is the global population aging. We live more years,
        and because of this, we also suffer from more diseases. In some cases,

        5. Water
    </h2>
    <p>
        Because all these investments don’t have to be necessarily related to
        technological improvements, we refer in this section to one of the
        oldest things in history. We are made for the most part out of water
        and we need water to survive. While people think on electricity or gas
        when investing in different companies, we could survive without these
        two, but water is essential for our survival. Other utilities such as
        oil and gold are also
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately. due to climatic change and other linked problems, water
        is becoming scarcer. Besides, accessing to water in some countries is
        still a nightmare. Out of the total water on earth, 97% is saltwater.,
        and out of the remaining 3%, another percentage is frozen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since we all need water and there is less for all of us, with the
        expected growth of the global population, the more demand and less
        supply means that the value of water will increase.

        Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
        We have described 5 sector that are expected to grow in the years to
        come at cruise speed. Investing in companies that are focused on these
        sectors can add additional diversification to our portfolio, add
        defensive or aggressive variants to it while we have some fun with our
        choice.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are other sectors that were not included in this post, but that
        will grow very much in the next decade. Some of them are the following
        ones: Blockchain, semiconductors or metaverse
    </p>
    <p>
        As mentioned in the introduction, even if they are expected to grow,
        the current price may already reflect the expected expansion and
        development of these industries.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another factor to be noted is liquidity. For example, if you want to
        buy or sell, there may be less options, not just in the form of funds
        or ETFs, but in the number of orders.
    </p>
    <p>
        All in all, there are some advantages and disadvantages when selecting
        niche funds. Therefore, I would not recommend including 100% of your
        portfolio into niche sectors. On the other hand, allocating just some
        of the money into these funds could be a wise and fun option for the
        future.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested on how to access to buy them, an example of
        different funds and ETFs has been included. You can see a list of
        brokers in one of my past articles:
