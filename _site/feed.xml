    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    While everybody is waiting for the most anticipated games in 2022 and it
    seems that it will be one of the best years in history with the likes of
    God of War: <strong>Ragnarok</strong>, <strong>Elden Ring</strong> or <strong>Horizon Forbidden West</strong>, today we are
    discussing some modern classics. Some of them were already released some
    years ago.
</p>
<p>
    All of them are playable in PS4 and in some cases you can also play in the
    PS5. The good news is that since they were released many years ago, you
    will find them for a very good price. If you are play too many games per year this article may not add much, but if you are a casual gamer like me, you may have missed some of these.
</p>
<h2>
    The Witcher 3
</h2>
<p>
    While the Witcher 1 and Witcher 2 don’t have a great mechanisms and
    controls, The Witcher 3 was a total breakthrough. Apart from continuing
    with a great story, it finally added a fantastic gameplay. It is still
    considered a total piece of art from the Polish company CD Projekt Red.
    These games count the adventures of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher – person
    whose job is killing monsters – who deals with different situations,
    monsters, characters, etc.
</p>
<p>
    In this game, the main enemy is the Wild Hunt- evil elf riders from
    another world -, trying to look for Ciri and you will have to protect her.
    This game also means the end of the story told in the 3 Witcher games. For
    that reason, it is not likely that there will be another game.
</p>
<p>
    If the main game was not enough, there are not 1 but 2 expansions
    available.
</p>
<p>
    The expansions are also excellent, and they are completely different one
    from another
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Hearts of the Stone</strong> focuses on a dark and more mystic adventure. In
        this one, Gerald will meet a mysterious man called Gaunter O’Dimm. Via
        this person, you will be asked to defeat a bandit called Olgierd von
        Everec, who is said to be immortal. The story is based mainly on these
        characters, but you will have to deal with new creatures and different
        mysteries.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Blood and Wine</strong> is the last expansion, set in Toussaint, where the
        landscape will remind you of France or Italy. In this city, you are
        asked by Duchess of Toussaint Anna Henrietta to solve the mystery of different killings
        in this region recently.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In the main game and the expansions, you will have the option to choose
    different paths and all the choices you make will have an in important
    impact on how the story evolves
</p>
<p>
    Related to the main game, it could be good to read some summaries of
    previous games (there is no need to play them) to know what’s going on, the
    different regions and allies or enemies. For this, watching the Netflix
    series will not help much since they are set in different times.

</p>
<h2>
    God of War
</h2>
<p>
    The creators of the God of War saga, Santa Monica Studio, made a great
    transition from their unique hack and slash style included in previous
    games with multiple changes in the last game. Further, it is undeniable
    that all these modifications in the gameplay improved the experience,
    taking profit of the latest consoles.
</p>
<p>
    Not just the gameplay changed, but also where the story is set. Kratos has
    changed Greece for Norway, where he will have to take care of his son,
    Atreus.
    Although I prefer the Greek mythology compared to the Norse one, there was
    not much to see since Kratos had killed almost every Greek god.
</p>
<p>
    Not just in the gameplay or the ambient you can see differences, but in the
    personality of the protagonist. Less selfish and more mature, you can see
    a clear evolution of the character if you have played the first games.
</p>
<p>
    The ghost of Sparta will meet new “friends” such as Baldur, Freya, Magni,
    Modi or Mimir. Apart from these Norse gods, the creatures are such trolls,
    dark elves or draugrs or even dragons. However, the most difficult part of
    the game – if you want to do so - is defeating the 9 Valkyries of the game.
</p>
<p>
    To defeat these enemies, you will also notice that your trusted blades of
    chaos are not anymore with you, and you are using a new weapon: an axe.
    However, as the game advances, you will have to recover the blades of chaos
    in order to defeat new enemies. You will have to guide Kratos through the
    different 6 playable realms
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Misgard
    </li>
    <li>
        Alfheim
    </li>
    <li>
        Helheim
    </li>
    <li>
        Jotunheim
    </li>
    <li>
        Muspelheim
    </li>
    <li>
        Nilfheim
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We are all waiting for the continuation of this game Ragnarok, which is to
    be released end of 2022. Apart from Thor, who know which other gods we will
    see there. Further, in the new game, we will be able to play in the realms
    that were not playable in the previous delivery: Vanaheim, Svartalfheim,
    and Asgard.
</p>
<p>
    In the meantime, if you like the Nordic culture, you may also try Assassins
    Creed Valhalla or check the gameplay below.

<h2>
    The Last of Us
</h2>
<p>
    I have never a fan of zombie, horror, or similar games. However, I bought
    The Last of Us by chance (there was a good offer) having seen the reviews.
    To be honest, I did not have a clue what was it about until I started
    playing it.
</p>
<p>
    This game tells the story of Joel, who is the main character, and Ellie is
    the girl you have to protect. Through the trip and the different
    apocalyptic places, you visit, you will also meet some old friends.
</p>
<p>
    The reason for having to protect her is that I have forgotten to say that
    most humans have an infection (Cordyceps brain infection). For that reason,
    they have become insane, and they attack also non-infected humans. That’s
    why also the status of the different places you visit.
</p>
<p>
    In the story you will find different types of infected who have different
    skills depending on the phase they are (Runners, Stalkers, Clickers, and
    Bloaters)
</p>
<p>
    IF you play at night, with the narrative and sounds, you will undoubtfully
    feel this sensation in any other game (except in the second part of this
    game)
</p>
<p>
    Where the variety of enemies is not as high as in the Witcher or God of War
    (the enemies are the infected and other humans), playing the game is like
    reading a good book or watching a move, where you are expecting to see
    what’s coming next.
</p>
<p>
    The adrenaline when running away from the infected ones, the dramatic turn
    of events, or the ingenuity you must use to defeat the enemies makes this
    game special. Even if it’s the oldest one in the list, the gameplay has not
    aged badly at all.
</p>
<p>
    I have the Last of Us 2 since a few months, but I did not have to play it.
    I cannot wait to do so and probably it could be one of the games that
    should be worth to mention.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, HBO is also preparing series about this where Pedro Pascal
    will play the role of Joel. We cannot wait to see this.
</p>
<p>
    Even if you are not the person who likes this type of games, I would
    encourage you to check some videos and try it.
</p>
<p>
    <iframe width="300" height="215" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HawhjjF5qFc" title="First minutes of the Last Of Us" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<h2>
    Uncharted 4
</h2>
<p>
    We finalize the list from another game from Naughty Dog. Uncharted 4 is the
    last game of the uncharted saga if you don’t take into account the
    expansion Lost Legacy. The fourth game is still about Nathan Drake, but
    this time he is retired as treasure hunter and adventurer. However, he will
    get soon get disturbed to do one final mission in order to help his
    brother.
</p>
<p>
    In the fourth game of the saga, you will have to search for English pirate
    Henry Avery’s treasure. To do so, you will visit many different locations.
    That’s why you will be able to see gorgeous landscapes, use different ways
    of transport and research in countries such as Panama, Madagascar. Scotland
    or Italy.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from the main timeline, there will be some missions set in the past,
    shown as flashbacks to better understand the story.:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You will for example be in a jail in Panama with your brother Samuel
        and your partner Rafe. This time is set before the events of the first
        game.
    </li>
    <li>
        You will also play a young Nathan when he was at the orphanage in
        Boston.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Although my preferred game is the second one, because of all the changes
    that brought to the series, the fourth and probably last game of the series
    is the most complete one in terms of graphics, visuals, and gameplay. It is
    also the one that closes the circle.
</p>
<p>
    As it occurs in The Last of Us, here you will just fight against humans (in
    previous games you will have to deal with some specific creatures, but I
    will not say more). However, this does not mean that it is worse. As it
    occurs with The Last of Us, here you will see a twisted story, different
    puzzles to be solved and some unexpected events that will hook you to your
    sofa.
</p>
<p>
    Sadly for the fans, the title “A Thief’s End” also may indicate that there
    will be no more Uncharted, unless there is another protagonist. There has
    been recently a film without very good reviews. However, whatever Naughty
    Dog is working on now, it will be a candidate for sure to be included in a
    similar list in the near future.
</p>

<h2>Other Classics Coming Soon</h2>
<p>
    We have come to the end of this post and we have mainly focused on PS4 games. However, we will talk soon about other classic games that you could consider.

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    Some posts ago we talked about different stores and brands. In those cases,
    the prices were mainly affordable since the brands, although offer very
    good quality, they are far from being considered luxury brands.
</p>
<p>
    In this article, I present you 4 Italian brands that are the
    exemplification of classic, sophisticated style combined with a delicate
    treatment of the different materials. They have been for some years
    selecting the best materials, and while other brands have preferred to
    focus on other aspects such as the latest trends, finding the best fabrics
    around the world continues to be one of th
    brands.
</p>
<p>
    The prices are of course high, but as opposed to other brands, when it
    comes to the attention to details, quality of fabric and country of
    manufacturing, this can of course be a valid justification.
</p>
<h2>
    Zegna
</h2>
<p>
    One of the staples from Zegna is the suit. Founded in the north of Italy,
    Trivero more specifically, Ermenegildo Zegna created the company in the
    1910s. However, he did not do this alone and his two brothers Mario and
    Edoardo helped him with the task of creating the company and its vision.
    The objective from Zegna was already clear in its inception, more than 100
    years ago:
</p>
<p>
    On one hand, they wanted to always find the best fabrics for each garment
    and each occasion. For that, they used to track different regions in search
    of the best product
</p>
<p>
    On another hand, innovation was already an important pillar of the company,
    combining it together with the best fabrics.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately for the consumers, the vision of the original founder remains
    unchanged today and they have not been transitioned to other styles or
    politics, as it has happened unfortunately with other classic houses.
</p>
<p>
    In Zegna, all materials such as wool and cashmere are carefully selected so
    they are perfect for suits and sweaters. Nonetheless, you will see
    exquisite products such as ties, shirts, or accessories to complete one
    man’s wardrobe.
</p>
<p>
    Although their style is classic, keeping the traditional tailoring as a
    service, called <em>Su Misura</em>, they also have collaborated with other
    brands on the crest of the wave, such as <strong>Fear of God</strong>. Further, thanks to different technologies they have also created the <strong>Tech Merino</strong> collection.
</p>
<p>
    Although the prices are in the top, it is possible to see the quality of
    the different garments from miles away, and you will not be wrong if you go
    for this option.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/italy/zegna.jpg" alt="More than 100 years of history">
    <span class="caption text-muted"> You can find <a href="https://www.zegna.com/">Zegna</a> in their website or
    other pages such as Mr Porter</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Canali
</h2>
<p>
    2 hours away from Trivero, close to Monza, Canali was founded just a few
    years before the second world war in Triuggio. It was founded by two
    brothers: Giacomo and Giovanni Canali, and the family still plays an
    important role in the company today. A family-owned based company, the
    focus on Canali lies on traditional menswear such as knitwear, suits, and
    shoes.
</p>
<p>
    The idea behind Canali is to keep a classic style but modernize it with
    minor enhancements constantly, also adapting the look to the contemporary
    times. They call it <strong>“modern elegance”</strong> and this term is very appropriate in
    his blog.
</p>
<p>
    Customers also play an important role in Canali’s history and they are
    important for them regardless of who they are. As it occurs with Zegna,
    they also offer an exclusive made to measure service, so you can see that
    the classic style is one of their signatures.
</p>
<p>
    Although it has less history than Zegna, and it is also probably less known,
    you cannot go wrong either if you decide to visit the shop from the
    province of Monza.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/italy/canali.jpg" alt="Modern Classic">
    <span class="caption text-muted">   Modern Elegance is how <a href="https://www.canali.com/">Canali</a> define their style and you can see an example
    above.</span>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2>
    E. Marinella
</h2>
<p>
    Since we have introduced two Italian brands from the north, it would be
    fair also to travel to see a different style from the South of Italy. And
    not, we are not checking Dolce &amp; Gabbana or similar. This brand is
    rather unknown and due to the relaxation of the outfits in last years
    (COVID-19 may have something to do), it may have lost presence in the
    recent years.
</p>
<p>
    We are talking about E. Marinella, which was found as Zegna in the 1910s.
    However, the company was created in Naples, where they started with a tiny
    20-meter shop. Marinella means “From the Sea” in Italian and you could
    guess that the shop is related to the Gulf of Naples or the Mediterranean
    Sea. However, the company owes its name to the creator Eugenio Marinella.
</p>
<p>
    However, if you don’t know E. Marinella is focused mainly on ties and
    handkerchiefs and what they wanted to achieve was replicating some of the
    British products and style in Italy. Since the usage of ties is less common
    nowadays, that’s why it may not be as famous one as the other brands listed
    here.
</p>
<p>
    As it occurs with Zegna and Canali, E. Marinella is focused on two
    different aspects:
</p>
<p>
    <strong> Materials </strong>: The characteristic prints and pattern of the ties are designed
    carefully and produced with the best silk prepared exclusively just for
    them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> Craftsmanship </strong>: Although they have invested in different technological
    machinery, some part of the fabrication is still manual, where the works
    prepare the ties with the utmost care. The ties are folded 5, 7 or 9 times to
    themselves, and you can note it when touching them.
</p>
<p>
    Although the format attire is losing more and more presence, we all must
    attend special occasions. For these events, the ties from E Marinella will
    for sure elevate your outfit and you will create an excellent impression to
    the hosts and other guests.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/italy/marinella.jpg" alt="Unique category of products">
    <span class="caption text-muted">    Even if it is just a picture, you can notice the quality of the ties from    <a href="https://www.emarinella.eu/">E. Marinella</a>.
    above.</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Bottega Veneta
</h2>
<p>
    This one is probably the most famous company, especially for women. If you
    know about Italian, you can see that in this case the name is quite simple:
    Bottega means shop and Veneta means Venetian – yes, we have come back to
    the North of Italy for this last section -. This is the only company listed
    in this post that does not have the origin in the founder of the company.
</p>
<p>
    As opposed to other brands, Bottega Veneta is focused more on women’s
    attires, or at least they have more options. Nonetheless, since we have
    already talked about different garments, it’s the time to focus on
    accessories for the daily activities. Bags, wallets, backpacks. This way,
    we complete the list, and we can have an outlook composed of just these
    brands.
</p>
<p>
    Their instant hit was the Intreciatto leather, technique that had been
    tried to replicate or imitated in some brands. It’s also the main
    characteristic today, giving the different accessories a unique feel.
    Intrecciato is called like that because of the way the leather is weaved.
    In the past, in the region the company was created, they were used to work
    just with clothes and the machinery were adapted to garments. In order to
    be able to recycle these machines, the leather had to be super thin. Once
    completed, the workers had to wove with this characteristic pattern to make
    the accessory more resistant.
</p>
<p>
    Although them were acquired 20 years ago approximately, they have not been
    corrupted and they have kept their unique design and exquisite
    craftsmanship. You can also see some of these pieces of art below.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/italy/bottega.jpg" alt="Intrecciatto is their signature">
    <span class="caption text-muted">        Classic and unique is what accessories from    <a href="http://www.bottegaveneta.com/">Bottega Veneta</a> are.
    above.</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Alla prossima
</h2>
<p>
    There are more Italian and non-Italian brands to come. For example, there
    are some brands from Italy which will be included in the future are the
    ones like <a href="https://www.bogliolimilano.com/">Boglioli</a>,<a href="https://www.corneliani.com/">Corneliani</a>,<a href="https://www.palzileri.com/fr/">Pal Zileri</a> or    <a href="https://www.slowear.com/">Incotex</a> (Slowear group). For the
    moment, we have seen a few and I hope that you have discovered at least one
    interesting company.

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    When it comes to accessories, I’m of the opinion that men should keep it
    simple. When I was young, I was taught that jewels are for women. On the
    other hand, men should keep it simple. There are different reasons for
    that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Too many accessories will steal attention to your look.
    </li>
    <li>
        Less is more when it comes to men’s fashion. Keep it simple.
    </li>
    <li>
        Unless you are a rapper, probably putting too many accessories will not
        look nice in your daily activities.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    From what you have read, you may already guess that I am not a fan rings,
    earrings or necklaces on men’s looks. However, a watch is something that
    every man should try to wear.
</p>
<p>
    Affordable or exclusive, some watches are undeniable icons and pieces of
    art. In next posts, I will talk about more affordable watches and modern
    classics. However, in this one we focus on models with some history and
    that unfortunately the price may also be exorbitant in some cases. This
    means that they are not for all pockets and even if so, you may prefer to
    spend that money in something else or investing as explained in this
    article.
</p>
<p>
    Here it is a small description of each watch, but you will not see any
    price listed. Please note that for some of them, there is a waiting list
    which could be excessive.
</p>
<h2>
    Rolex submariner
</h2>
<p>
    Introduced in the 1950s, the Submariner Is probably the most famous watch
    in the luxury models. Although it had seen several improvements in terms of
    movements and water resistance, it has kept is essence. Due to its
    versatility and the good marketing, many brands used this design to create
    similar divers.
</p>
<p>
    One of the most know famous campaigns was in the James Bond movies: Dr No
    and From Russia with Love. It remains a classic nowadays and there are
    different versions, material, and colors of it.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from inspiring models from other brands, Rolex has also created new
    models out of the Submariner. A clear example of this is the <strong>Sea-Dweller</strong> introduced in the late 1960s.
</p>
<p>
    For the stated reasons, it is probably one of the most recognizable watches
    in the planet. Since it’s a classic, it may take some time until you can
    buy it from your authorized dealer. On the other hand, we have already said
    that many brands have used this model as inspiration. For this reason,
    there are some alternatives in case you are looking for something more
    affordable
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Orient Mako
    </li>
    <li>
        Casio Duro
    </li>
    <li>
        Omega Seamaster

</p>
<h2>
    Audemars Piguet Royal Oak
</h2>
<p>
    The watch house from Le Brassus owes too much to the Royal Oak model.
    Mainly, because without this model, the company would probably not exist
    today. In the 1970’s the Swiss company realized that they would go bankrupt
    if they did not introduce a disrupting model. It was in full era of the
    quartz crisis, triggered by Japanese makers when Audemars Piguet realized
    that they had to disrupt the market.
</p>
<p>
    At that time, the watch company hired Gerald Genta to create something
    unique and completely different to previous watches the house had created.
    This was the creation of a steel sports watch, integrated into a bracelet
    and completely in stainless steel.
</p>
<p>
    Although Audemars Piguet had already a reputation back then, and focused on
    classic dress watches, the Royal Oak is the insignia from this house.
    Today, there are multiple versions of this watch, such as limited editions.
    Furthermore, other companies have taken inspirate from this model.
    Initially just in stainless steel, you may find different variations of
    this model in precious metals, alligator, or rubber strap.
</p>
<p>
    The Royal Oak has appreciated in the last years and the waiting list
    average is 8 years. For that reason, these are some alternatives in
    different price ranges.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        G Shock GA-2100 (Casioak)
    </li>
    <li>
        Tissot PRX Powermatic 80
    </li>
</ul>

    <span class="caption text-muted">The model with the blue dial is the most iconic version of this watch</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Zenith el Primero
</h2>
<p>
    Although it is not considered in the top tier list of watches, it’s one of
    the most famous watch companies and Zenith has indeed a lot of horological
    history.
</p>
<p>
    However, as it occurs with many topics, the model we are discussing today
    was a total failure on the early stages and there are different reasons for
    this unsatisfactory project.
</p>
<p>
    Zenith started developing some years before the release the first automatic
    chronograph. They released it finally in 1969, with a total project
    duration of 7 years. Just before the release, on the same year, other two
    companies release a Chronograph, being Seiko and Chronographic in that
    order. For that reason. It is not correct to call it “El Primero” (the
    first one). Nonetheless, out of these 3 chronographs, El Primero is the
    most sophisticated and complex one. That’s why it included in the history
    books, and you can find today different versions and reinterpretations of
    it, such as the Skeleton version.
</p>
<p>
    It’s not as sporty as the other models, but you can put it with almost
    anything. In case you would like to buy it, it is less exclusive than the
    other ones listed in this post. You can even buy it from Mr Porter, shop
    that was included in this <a href="https://mrfreire.net/2022/03/06/shops-for-the-modern-man-part-I/">post</a>post. If you want to look for alternative
    chronographs, some of models that are similar to El Primero are the following ones:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Rolex Daytona - this is pricier than the Zenith Model and we will talk
        soon about it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Orient panda
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/watches/zen.jpg" alt="Multiple versions">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Multiple reworks and versions of El Primero exist today</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Patek Philippe Nautilus
</h2>
<p>
    Having seen the success of the Royal Oak, another member of the Holy
    Trinity (the other member being Vacheron Constantin) did not want to be
    second to none and they asked the creator of the AP model, Gerald Genta, to
    design a steel and sports watch. If you know about the company from Geneva,
    you will know that they have and were focused on more classic models such
    as the dress watch Calatrava.
</p>
<p>
    Genta was inspired in a ship’s porthole to create the Nautilus, name also
    linked to Captain Nemo’s submarine in the Jules Vern Twenty Thousand
    Leagues Under the Sea novel. When it was created in the mid 70s, the watch
    looked huge and for that reason the success was not immediate. However, the
    undeniable elegant, sporty, and modern design grew slowly on watch lovers
    and has finally become a legend.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, today’s price is even higher than the one of Royal Oak (not
    going into details about the price) if you can afford it. As it occurred
    with the Royal Oak, during these years, there have been different versions
    of the watch in terms of size, caliber, and different limited editions.
    Another top model from this house is the Aquanaut model, which has
</p>
<p>
    The Nautilus is by far the most exclusive watch in this list, but again, we
    are not talking about the price. Furthermore, the waiting list may be
    comparable to the one of the Royal Oak.
</p>
<p>
    Although the design of the Nautilus is unique, here are some alternatives,
    although these ones are not precisely cheap.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Girrard Perregaux Laureato
    </li>
    <li>
        Bulgari Octo Finissimo
    </li>
</ul>
<p>

    <span class="caption text-muted">The Nautilus is the most famous model of the house and there is a model for every taste</span>

<h2>
    More classics to come
</h2>
<p>
    We have been talking about classic sport watches that you could wear in
    almost every occasion. You may have noticed that there are no dress watches
    in this list. Although I really like them, like happened with the video
    killing the radio star, sport watches seem to have killed the dress
    watches.
</p>
<p>
    Maybe not killing, but the presence of classic dress watches has been
    reduced considerably in the last years. Who knows if they will be on the top again
    in a few years from now? However, for the moment, we have described 4 more
    sport watches that can also fit with any look. If you wear one of these or
    their alternative modes, there is no need to at all to add any jewel or
    extravagant accessories to your look

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    Cash is less and less used and the different technologies, the regulations
    and COVID-19 have all something to do with this. Although the future may
    not be necessarily in the hands of cards, which are a product that has
    barely evolved in the recent years, they are still the preferred paying
    method.
</p>
<p>
    In this post, we are including the best cards that you can find in the
    market. When I mention the best, I’m referring to the best quality price
    relationship. Therefore, if you are looking for products such as the
    American Express Centurion or alike, you will have to wait.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that due to the banking licenses and regulations, some of these
    cards may not be available in some countries. This is because I just
    recommend what I use, or I have used.
</p>
<h2>
    Revolut
</h2>
<p>
    Revolut is one of the most valuable FinTech in the world and the most
    valuable fintech in UK, where it is based. It’s also probably the most
    famous company in this list.
</p>
<p>
    Aside debit cards, they also offer other financial products such as vaults,
    trading and crypto. However, nothing against these services, but I think
    there are much better options out there if for example you are thinking on
    trading stocks or crypto.
</p>
<p>
    Revolut has been growing exponentially in the last years thanks to their
    inexistent or low fees, application design and associated benefits.
</p>
<p>
    The most known characteristic of Revolut is that there are no currency
    conversion fees on card payments.
</p>
<p>
    Nonetheless, on weekends, the exchange rate fee is increased. In any case,
    even if there are some fees on the weekends, the rate is favorable than
    more traditional services.
</p>
<p>
    Besides, if you use premium, you have unlimited transfer of foreign
    currencies.
    If you are abroad, you can also withdraw money from ATMs, up to a certain
    limit for free.
</p>
<p>
    These characteristics make Revolut the perfect card for travelling and
    short stays in foreign countries. Furthermore, there were some great news
    at the end of 2021 since Revolut was granted the full banking license by
    the European Central Bank.
</p>
<p>
    There are some options (Premium, Metal) for which the service will not be
    free and depending on your situation, it may be worth to check these. For
    example, if you transfer every month considerable amounts of foreign
    currency, it may be important to upgrade. At least on my case, this is more
    beneficial.
</p>
<h3>
    Revolut Business case
</h3>
<p>
    The most obvious case is for travelling to foreign countries, but there are
    many more usages.
</p>
<p>
    Compared to other banks, one of the things I like most about Revolut is the
    instant transfer of money. If I transfer to my other accounts, the money is
    there in milliseconds. The other situation relevant on my case is to
    transfer different currencies. For example, if you can just deposit USD in
    your broker (e.g., crypto), this is a way method to transfer your local
    currency into USD without hidden fees.
</p>
<h3>
    Revolut Features
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Nice design of the app
    </li>
    <li>
        No currency conversion fees (except weekends) in transfers and card
        payments
    </li>
    <li>
        Immediate transfers without fees
    </li>
    <li>
        Excellent security management
    </li>
    <li>
        Different partnerships for cash back
    </li>
    <li>
        Getting more and more banking license (e.g., EU license)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In case you would like to open an account, you can open it from this    <a href="https://www.revolut.com/">link</a>. You will receive a reward of
    70 in your local currency when opening it with this link and following some

</p>
<h2>
    N26
</h2>
<p>
    The origin of the name comes from the number of smaller cubes in a Rubik’s
    cube. Founded in 2013 in Munich, N26 is a German neobank with a huge
    customer base in Europe and the US.
</p>
<p>
    N26 offers a basic account and a debit card in the entry level. For these
    products, there are no fees. The customer can add more services (N26 You
    and N26 Metal) if needed and for these ones, there will be a monthly fee.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to open the account, the registration will take around 10
    minutes.
</p>
<p>
    ATM withdrawals are also free up to a certain amount per month.
</p>
<p>
    They will also send the card for free when you top up your account for the
    first time. In most countries you can also use your mobile to pay since it
    is compatible with Apple Pay and Google Pay.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of exchange rates, there rate may be slightly worse than the
    ones from Revolut. However, the conversion is constant on all days of the
    week. For foreign currency transfers, they are since a few months with
    Wise.
</p>
<h3>
    N26 Business case
</h3>
<p>
    In my case, I use it as a daily card in Europe. One trick I use is the
    following one. DAZN is a streaming service from Germany and available in
    many locations. However, the offering of DAZN Germany is much better than
    the one for other countries. For that reason, I have an account in DAZN
    Germany and I use my N26 to pay with it, since they detect that it is a
    German bank.
</p>
<h3>
    N26 Features
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Great app
    </li>
    <li>
        No currency conversion fees card
    </li>
    <li>
        Cheap foreign currency transfers
    </li>
    <li>
        Good security management
    </li>
    <li>
        EU banking license
    </li>
    <li>
        Since it is a German account, you may use it to access services in
        Germany (e.g., DAZN DE offers)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    At the moment, there is no current promotion, but you may open an account
    from their <a href="https://n26.com/en-eu">website</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/cards/n26.jpg" alt="N26">
    <span class="caption text-muted">N26 is one of the application that has grown considerably in Europe.</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Neon
</h2>
<p>
    The last one in the list is a Swiss digital bank, and it is just restricted
    to people living in Switzerland. Neon offers a bank, a phone application,
    and a debit card. Everything for free. Apart from not having any expenses,
    you can also have up to two ATM withdrawals per month.
</p>
<p>
    Neon is also compatible with Apple Pay and Google Play. On top of this,
    Neon is also compatible with TWINT (if you are in Switzerland, you know
    what this is).
</p>
<p>
    Although Neon does not have a banking license the Hypothekarbank Lenzburg
    manages the different accounts. For that reason, under the Swiss Banking
    Law, the deposited is insured up to 100,000 CHF.
</p>
<p>
    If you are abroad, you don’t pay exchange rate fees in card transactions.
    On the other hand, for cash withdrawals in foreign currency, there is a
    1.5% fee.
</p>
<p>
    Neon also offers a more premium account, which is called Neon Green. The
    features of Neon Green are not focused mainly on the customer, but the
    society. For each Neon Green user, Neon plants 35trees every month.
    Further, for every 100 CHF spent, an additional tree is planted. For
    example, if you spend 4,000 CHF, they will plan 45 trees in one single
    month.
</p>
<p>
    On top of that, you also have an extended warranty of 3 years, thanks that
    they have a partnership with hanks to our partner, Europäische
    Reiseversicherung (ERV) . All this is just for 5 CHF, which makes is quite reasonable.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that even the registration process takes 10 minutes, you will
    need to show residency permit (e.g., if you just arrived in Switzerland).
</p>
<h3>
    Neon Business case
</h3>
<p>
    In my case, if you have Neon Green, you get a 3-year warranty extension for
    all electronic and electrical products. You always have two-year warrant
    for your products, so this means that you will have a total    <strong>warranty of 5 years.</strong> Despite the different technological
    breakthroughs, planned obsolescence is at the order of the day. This way,
    we are more than covered.
</p>
<h3>
    Neon Features
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Beautiful app
    </li>
    <li>
        Integration with mobile payments
    </li>
    <li>
        No exchange rate fees
    </li>
    <li>
        Cheap foreign currency transfers
    </li>
    <li>
        Neon green
    </li>
    <li>
        Integration with <a href="https://www.twint.ch/en/">TWINT</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can download neon via this <a href="https://www.neon-free.ch/en/">link</a>.
    If you want to start with 20 CHF, you can use code <strong>LTM55N</strong> when you
    register.

    <span class="caption text-muted">If you live in Switzerland, Neon is a must for you.</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    In all these cases, for the basic service (account and debit card), there
    are no monthly fees or any disadvantage for using them. In my case I have
    all of these, but you can of course select just the one that suits you
    best. In case of emergency card, it is always a possibility to have others.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the promotions may vary from time to time and the amounts
    may also be bigger or lower. In all cases, if any reward, you and I get the
    same amount. However, the purpose of this article is just showing different
    advantages and help people move away from other banks with abusive fees and
    less benefits.

<p>
        I strongly believe, as some famous people have said, that investing in yourself
        is the best choice you can make in order to learn new skills and
        overcome your weaknesses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nowadays we are seeing a surge of online platforms and definitely users
        have more chances of learning something new and applying these skills. The
        times of having to go to physical classes is hopefully over.
    </p>
    <p>
        Learning doesn’t necessarily mean studying or joining some classes. You can
        certainly learn new skills by listening, reading or observing how other
        people act.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nonetheless, we are leaving these last actions for another post and in this
        article I’m introducing different courses that could be beneficial in your
        future.
    </p>
    <h2 class="section-heading">
        Corporate finance – IESE Business School
    </h2>
    <p>
        I remember this was my first course at Coursera. I had also no clue about
        the finance world, and it opened many doors in future years. It is also the
        only course I have taken more than once since I really liked it how the
        teacher, Javier Estrada, explained the different topics clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this course you will understand how companies are financed to run their
        business and projects, how the interact with different actors of the global
        financial markets, and different formulas, etc. All in all, after course
        you will understand almost every topic you read in the financial news.
    </p>
    <p>
        For some years, there was a huge demand to have Part II of the course and I
        saw it few months ago that there is indeed a second part. It is also part
        of the specialization Think like a CFO, which includes other 2 courses that
        are detailed better in the sections below.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can find access to the single course or the specialization below.

            Think like a CFO
        </a>
    </p>
    <h2 class="section-heading">
        Investment Management – University of Geneva
    </h2>
    <p>
        The investment management course is provided by the University of Geneva in
        collaboration with UBS. The specialization is composed of 4 courses,
        focusing on different finance topics. It starts with an explanation of how
        financial markets work, portfolio allocation, psychological topics that may
        impact our decisions
    </p>
    <p>
        You will finalize the courses seeing other topics such as risk management,
        and new trends such as ESG, HFT or Robo-Advisors.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also interesting to see some real cases that occurred in the past,
        such as the Black Monday. It will conclude with a capstone project where
        you must define the portfolio of one of your clients.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested on switching to finance in your career, I would say
        that this is one of the best courses that you could start.

        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/foundations-management?">
            Investment Management

    </p>
    <h2 class="section-heading">
        Foundations of Management – IESE Business School
    </h1>
    <p>
        I remember taking this course around the time I was promoted to Manager in
        a consulting company . As the title says, the specialization focuses on 4
        pillars of corporate management and it is not entirely focused on finance.
        The 4 components that are taught in this MOC are:
        <ul>
        <li>Accounting</li>
        <li>Finance For Managers</li>
        <li>Marketing</li>
        <li>Organizational Behavior</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        The first two courses are related to financial topics and how to understand
        the figures of companies, which is one of the most important things to make
        sure that they can work. These are also part of the CFO specialization
        mentioned before.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last 2, are related to marketing strategies and management of people
        within the organization. Although they are not 100% related to finance, it
        is quite likely that they will play an important role future career.
    </p>
    <p>
        Analysis of Business Problems. In this last course and it is a capstone
        project. There you will apply all the skills that you learnt with a real
        case from some years ago and the GasGas enduro and motocross brand.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can find the 5 courses described above in the following link.

    <p>
        The last course in this list is probably the most famous one. If not, the
        teacher is probably you may have heard of because he is nothing less than
        the Nobel prize winner Robert Schiller.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whereas the previous ones were specializations, this one is just a single
        course. However, it is longer than a usual course and it is divided into 7
        weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of the course is to go through almost every possible topic to
        understand the whole finance picture. Every week, there is a different
        topic and the ones below are the most important ones that are explained by
        Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
        Corporate finance, insurance, different securities, bubbles, recessions,
        mortgage crisis (e.g., Case–Shiller index, derivatives, investment banking,
        brokers or new innovations in the future are some of the topics that you
        will observe in the series of lessons.

        Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
        Nowadays, unfortunately for most courses you have to pay. However, if not
        mistaken, the one from Robert Shiller is still free. In any case, any of
        the 4 courses or specializations is totally worth it and you also have the
        choice of trying those for 7 days for free.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some topics to investigate in these links and I do not want to
        overwhelm you with too many courses at once. In a few weeks, I will
        introduce other courses that may help you in your professional future, but
        not necessarily linked to finance (or yes). In these cases, all of them are
        from Coursera, but in the future articles I will try to present other
        platforms.

        In the meantime, happy learning!

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    There are different daily routines that every person should do when waking
    up . Although it is normal taking a shower is the first thing we do when we
    get up, it is also common knowledge that we don’t pay attention to other
    aspects of our body such as the face. The same applies in the evening when
    we should clean our face. In this article, I’m explaining the different
    steps and a recommended product in order to improve our skin health and
    look younger.
</p>
<p>
    I’m also recommending some products that may help you with this. Please
    note that depending on your skin type, it may be better to choose a
    different product. For thaese cases, I will also recommend other products
    in the upcoming articles related to this post.
</p>
<p>
    It should be clear that I’m just mentioning some steps and for example the
    topics and applications of essence, Retin A or sunscreen are not included
    in this post.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of each section, I will include a link where you can get these
    products with the guaranteed lowest price. However, please feel free to try
    other products or get them somewhere else.
</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">
    Cleansing Gel
</h2>
<p>
    We start with a refreshing cleanser in order to remove all the accumulated
    dirtiness, excess of oil and impurities. This product will also revitalize
    our skin and make it calm, soft and relaxed.
</p>
<p>
    After applying it, you can rinse it and you are ready to go to the next
    step.

    Toner
</h2>
<p>
    The purpose of the toner is to hydrate the skin and to remove the dead
    cells. It also acts as the base for the next products that are applied into
    our face. The toner should refresh your skin and don’t create any
    irritation or issue on it.

    Serum
</h2>
<p>
    Serums contain countless number of active components and there are so many
    for each face and skin types that we could write several articles to
    discuss about them. They contain high amount of ntioxidants or peptides
    that penetrate your skin (after having applied the toner)
</p>
<p>
    In this post, I’m just introducing one with hyaluronic acid, but in further
    posts you will see me recommending a different one.
</p>
<p>
    There is no shortage of them, so I will be discussing other brands soon.

    Once we have completed the steps above, we include the final touch with the
    moisturizer. The moisturizer’s goal is to help fight against usual suspects
    such as dryness or acne. The final objective is that after having applied
    all these steps your skin looks healthy, happy and great.

<h2 class="section-heading">
    Exfoliation
</h2>
<p>
    I have left the exfoliation for the last part, although it should be
    applied just after the cleanser. The reason is that you should not
    exfoliate your skin every day-
</p>
<p>
    There are many exfoliating types such as physical or chemical. In this case
    we are focusing on the physical face scrubs. Via the exfoliation we remove
    dead cells and we clean our skin. However, the process is more aggressive
    than the steps we described above. For that reason, it should not be used
    more than 3-4 times a week and depending on your skin type it may be even
    not recommended doing that more than twice a week.
</p>

    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    Following these methods will make that you skin younger and replenished,
    removing some years.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, after following the different steps, you will feel refreshed
    and ready for a new day.
</p>
<p>
    The products are selected on the utmost care, but please do your own
    research. Every person and every skin are different.
</p>
<p>
    As discussed, the products may be available in different places. However, I
    have been always found cheaper at iHerb. The purpose of the article is not
    sharing any referral code, but in case this helps. You may find some
    discounts using the code below:

<p>In this article we are changing completely the topic, and we are introducing 4 online shops where modern men can go for shopping and find the next essential item for their daily activities.</p>
<p>The shops listed here have been included since they are international, and they should be accessible to all or most visitors around the world.&nbsp; They have been on business for several years and apart from the quality, you should always expect a top-notch customer service.</p>
<p>The list has been prepared with the utmost care based on my experience after so many years of shopping in these stores.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Mr Porter</h2>
<p>We start the list with a company that was created from to the Net a Porter group, focused on the men apparel. Some years ago, the Net-a-Porter group merged with Yoox and that&rsquo;s why you will see in this page some articles that were available at Mr Porter in previous seasons.</p>
<p>Mr Porter is an online retailer for men fashion. Since the need to put emphasis on the digital world, the application and the website are top quality. They have multiple brands of the most recognizable brands in the world and every year they add new brands (whether they are newcomers to the industry or old players).</p>
<p>Since a few years, they have their own brand: Mr Porter which offers a good quality for the price. Needless to say, that the designs and quality are of the same standards of the other brands listed in this site.</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/stores/mp/mrp.jpg" alt="Unique design">
<span class="caption text-muted">Both website and application offer an outstanding experience</span>
<h3>Key topics</h3>
<p>The most important things to pay attention to for me are:</p>
<p>The exclusive collections just available at Mr Porter. Some of them in the past are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ermenegildo Zegna for Fear of God</li>
<li>Brunello Cuccinelli x Mr Porter</li>
<li>Kingsman, (yes, the ones from the film)</li>
<li>Tom Ford x Mr Porter</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite starting with a few brands, the portfolio of brands and categories is today countless: shoes, bags, art, watches, or sports are other things that you will see in this store.</p>
<p>There is a section called &ldquo;The Journal&rdquo; which is also interesting, introducing other lifestyle topics such as cities or restaurants. What I also like is to receive the news about what&rsquo;s new every week.</p>
<p>The sale season starting end of December and June is one of the most waited periods of the year for many people. &nbsp;In this period, you can have huge discounts on the most reputable brands of the world.</p>
<p>You can know more about Mr Porter from the following link: <a href="https://www.mrporter.com/">Mr Porter</a></p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Uniqlo</h2>
<p>We continue with a Japanese which is very famous in this country, but maybe not that much in other regions of the world. Nonetheless, with their current expansion plans, it may not take long until you hear it about Uniqlo more often.</p>
<p>The retailer from Yamaguchi was founded in 1984 and their focus is on clothes that are basic, functional, have good quality, beauty and they have a fair price. On top of these characteristics, they offer good quality and affordable prices. Who wants more?</p>
<p>The designs you will see in this shop (for men and women) are for that reason not innovative in terms of fashion, but they will be modern classics that will last long in terms of quality and design.</p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/stores/un/uni.jpg" alt="Basic and functional">
<span class="caption text-muted">Apart from these two attributes, they also combine beauty and collaborate with other top designers</span>
<h3>Key topics</h3>
<p>Apart from the essentials, which offer an excellent price quality relation, one of the other remarkable characteristics from Uniqlo are the collaborations they have at almost every time of the year. They collaborate with different artists and brands.</p>
<p>Some of the most remarkable collections and collaboration are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heattech (Specific technology for cold temperatures)</li>
<li>Uniqlo x <a href="https://www.jwanderson.com/">JW Anderson</a></li>
<li>J+ (<a href="https://www.jilsander.com/">Jil Sander</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you a have a store close to you, it may worth checking it. They have some promotions, where you may receive some free articles and you will have to rate them and publish a review.</p>
<p>You can visit the Japanese brand in their website: <a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/">Uniqlo</a></p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Massimo Dutti</h2>
<p>We leave two Spanish brands for the final part of this article. Although the name could indicate that the company is Italian, this is not the case. The brand from Arteixo is one of my favorites when it comes to quality and price. Although the products are made in different parts of the world, it is not strange to see clothes and accessories made in Spain, Portugal or even Italy.</p>
<p>Compared to the sister brands such as Zara, it offers a more classic style, higher quality and the prices are just slightly more expensive than the other fast-fashion brands.</p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/stores/md/lis_01.jpg" alt="Modern classic">
<span class="caption text-muted">Massimo Dutti is synonymous of a classic sophisticated style</span>
<h3>Key topics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Limited edition: Around September and April, you may see special limited edition collections with nice designs.</li>
<li>Personal Tailoring: Since several years, Massimo Dutti has been offering a special service focused on suits and tailoring. The quality of the suits and shirts is above their &ldquo;normal&rdquo; ones, and I would suggest going for this option.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of leather items, they are also very good such as bags and other wallets or mobile cases. In terms of sale season, although the price is already quite affordable, you may also see some aggressive discounts too.</p>
<p>Massimo Dutti is available in almost every country: <a href="https://www.massimodutti.com/">Massimo Dutti</a></p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Meermin</h2>
<p>Since we are talking about leather items, we stay in Spain, but we close our journey to the Mediterranean Sea. More specifically. we stay in the town of Inca in Mallorca.</p>
<p>This online shop is not about clothes, but shoes. You will be different classic shoes such as: oxford, brogues, boots or buckles at very good price ranges.</p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/stores/me/me.jpg" alt="MTO groups">
<span class="caption text-muted">MTO groups are an original idea from Meermin</span>
<h3>Key topics</h3>
<p>Apart from the quality and prices, something I really like are the MTO (Mate to Order) groups.</p>
<p>For a specific period, there are some specific models available. These shoes will be unique because they will not be available again. The process is based on the crowdfunding model for which the customers decide which shoe model is produced. In order to fund the shoes, the 100% of the goal must be reached.</p>
<p>Please note that since the prices are already too competitive. It is not common that you will see sales or special orders here, as in the previous three stores we described above.</p>
<p>If you prefer to try the shoes physically, there a few stores in the word: Madrid, Paris, and New York. Otherwise, they send order to almost every part of the world.</p>
<p>Meermin is growing more and more and available in different locations: <a href="https://www.meermin.com/">Meermin</a></p>

<h2> More shops to come </h2>
<p>With these 4 stores we conclude today&rsquo;s story. They are part of the essentials that every man can use. However, there are many other options and it will not take long until I present you another 4 stores I use and buy from.</p>]]></content><author><name>Javier Freire</name></author><category term="porter" /><category term="uniqlo" /><category term="clothes" /><category term="massimo" /><category term="dutti" /><category term="ford" /><category term="zegna" /><category term="meermin" /><category term="cuccinelli" /><category term="kingsman" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[4 online shops to find the next essential item.

<p>
    In the recent years, we have been suffering a 0% interest rate policy in
    our deposits. In some cases, this has been translated even into negative
    interest into some countries or abusive custody or management fees.
    I have been always not happy about this topic, since we are lending our
    money to the banks (in some cases charging us for that money) and with that
    money, they lend it to other customers, for which they charge an abusive
    interest rate.
</p>
<p>
    Although in the past decades there has not been any breakthrough in
    traditional finance (I just think about ATMs and credit cards), for the
    past years a new concept known as DeFi has been introduced and it’s getting
    more traction. Every year, there are several projects related to it, mainly
    linked to blockchains and different crypto currencies.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of this article is not praising the different benefits of DeFi
    and criticising the traditional finance. The goal is just to show that
    there are more alternatives to depositing the money in the bank, giving us
    a 0% on it.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What's Anchor?</h2>

<p>
    For that, I am showing those who are not aware of Anchor Protocol. What’s
    this? Anchor is a platform that offers both savings account and a lending
    platform.
</p>
<p>
    In this article we are just focusing on the savings account, for which
    depositors get approximately an APY of 19.5%.
</p>
<p>
    The deposits are in TerraUSD (UST) , which is the Terra stable coin. The
    value of this coin is pegged to the USD and there is a mechanism to make
    sure that the value keeps pegged to the UST. There are some interesting
    videos about this algorithm and other projects such as White Whale that
    use it to get extra APY on the arbitrage. You can find additional references in this link <a href="#z">Useful links</a>.
</p>
<p>
    This means that with a deposit of 10,000 UST, we will get around 2,000 UST
    after one year. The UST is compounded daily and reflected in your deposit.
    For example, in one week, you get around 38 UST with the example above.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the APY slightly varies and it is likely the case that
    once there are several adopters of UST, the APY will reduced.
</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/anchor.jpg" alt="Anchor Protocol">
<span class="caption text-muted">Anchor Protocol offers a flexible savings account with no minimum deposit and no commitment.</span>

<h2 class="section-heading">How to deposit into Anchor Protocol</h2>

<p>
    We have said that the Anchor works with UST. You cannot deposit fiat or any
    other stable coins. Some months ago, it was more difficult to get UST.
    Fortunately, it is now more and more extended and there are more and more
    different options. The last exchange that listed UST was Kraken. In terms
    of fees, this may be also the most convenient one if you are living in
    Europe.
</p>
<p>
    Before explaining briefly the different alternatives, you will need a Terra
    Station wallet. This wallet is the official one from TerraForm Labs and
    it’s used to manage the different Terra tokens (UST, LUNA, etc.)
</p>
<p>
    There are some Chrome extensions and mobile applications for it. Once you
    have set it up, you will be able to send the UST (or LUNA) to your Terra
    Station address.
</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">How to buy UST</h2>

<p>
    There is an option to buy directly UST from Fiat in the Anchor protocol.
    The service is called Transact and it is displayed in the Anchor Protocol
    site. However, the conversion fees are quite high and there are cheaper
    options explained below.
</p>
<p>
    Preparing the document, I have just seen that there is a new option (more
    and more exchanges are listing UST). This service is called Kado Ramp and
    the fee (2 UST) seems more affordable than Transakt.

    Kraken is one of the most famous exchanges. In this case, the fiat deposit
    is free. You have options such as EUR and USD and you have pairs EUR/UST
    and USD/UST, meaning that you don’t have to convert to another coin to get
    UST.
</p>
<p>
    The withdrawal fee to your Terra Station is 1 UST. The trading fees are
    quite low and the details are in the website. Expect around 1 UST per 1,000
    EUR.
</p>
  <h3 class="section-heading">Binance</h3>
    <a href="https://www.binance.com/">https://www.binance.com/</a>
<p>
    I cannot give my opinion about Binance US. The solution in Finance is
    depositing USD, and you get BUSD (the stable coin from Binance). This means
    that you are losing some part of the USD because the ratio is not exactly
    1:1. Furthermore, you may also incur some transactions fees or exchange
    rate fees if your account currency is not quoted in USD.
</p>
<p>
    From there, you can buy UST with BUSD. In this exchange, the withdrawal fee
    to the Terra Wallet is also 1 UST.
</p>
  <h3 class="section-heading">Coinbase</h3>
    <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">https://www.coinbase.com/</a>
<p>
    Please note that UST is also available in Coinbase, but this is not native
    UST and you cannot send it directly to Terra Station. You will need to
    convert it (e.g. using MetaMask) and this will incur high fees.
</p>
<p>
    What you can do in Coinbase (Coinbase Pro for smaller fees) is either buying XLM (Stellar) or LTC
    (Litecoin) due to the low trading / transfer fees. You can send those to
    KuCoin and convert them to another stable coin such as USDT in order to
    convert them again to UST. The withdrawal fee in this case is 2 UST (it
    used to be 4 UST).
</p>
<p>
    In Kucoin there are also SOL/UST pairs, so you could buy Solana in Coinbase
    and send it to KuCoin to the different transactions.
</p>
<p>
    This option may be more expensive compared to the ones listed below.
</p>
<p>
    Another option that exists is buying LUNA (TERRA) in any of the stock
    exchanges and sending it to your Terra Station. Terra Station has an option
    to swap LUNA / UST and the fee is 0.1%. This was the most convenient
    approach when UST was not listed in many exchanges.
</p>
<p>
    What Anchor brings is a new concept for people tired of traditional banks
    and abusive rates. This is the crown of the jewell of the DeFi projects out
    there. Furthermore, this is a more conservative approach than buying crypto
    currencies, whose value fluctuates so much.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, this is not a risk-free value and there may be some
    risks to be evaluated:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Smart contracts hack
    </li>
    <li>
        Depeg of UST to USD
    </li>
    <li>
        Losing the Wallet
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    My piece of advice is not putting all the eggs on the same nest,
    regardless of the reputation of the protocol or asset type. In the next
    weeks, I will introduce other DeFi protocols that could be interest to you.

<p>The emerging markets had the worst decade since the 30&rsquo;s in 2020 and 2021 was not much better compared to previous years. In 2022, we are seeing some minor improvements in these markets. But is there any hope for countries composing the emerging countries?</p>
<p>Here are some reasons to think that something is changing quietly to some of these markets or regions.</p>
<p>With the current interest rate policies from the ECB or the Federal Reserve, the currencies from the analyzed emerging countries are now more competitive compared to previous years. Further, they have avoided borrowing and increasing their national debt.</p>
<p>While western developed countries (US and Europe) are focused on conflicts, emerging countries have the time to focus on economy.</p>
<p>Apart from these common advantages, these are 5 of the emerging countries that will play&nbsp;an important role in the years to come.</p>
<h2>Vietnam</h2>
<p>An underdog and unknown by many in terms of financial markets, Vietnam is silently growing and leaving some analysts with the mouth open.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Vietnam was one of the poorest countries in the world. However, since the reform of the Đổi Mới in the 80s, the growth has been stellar and there are several reasons to believe that this growth will continue</p>
<p>With the recent Covid and other situations, Vietnam is one of the fastest growing countries. For example, in 2020, Vietnam&rsquo;s economy was the best perform amongst all Asian countries. and its objective by 2045 is to be a high-income country. In order to achieve this objective, the population is expected to grow by 10% during this time, which will of course help with this goal</p>

<p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/vietnam.jpg" alt="Vietnam">
<span class="caption text-muted">Vietnam has been one of the best-performer economies in the recent years and it is expected to grow further.</span>
</p>
<h2>Philippines</h2>
<p>By 2050, Philippines is expected to have a population of around 150 million. It is at that time, when it is expected that Philippines will be in the Top 15 economies of the world. Philippines did not grow much until the 21st century. However, the growth has been fast in the last two decades, focusing on the services sector. Due to these reasons, it has become one of the rising tigers in the Pacific region.</p>
<p>Some of the reasonings for this growth is that Philippines has a young workforce, the population speaks English and the household debt that is low compared to other countries in Asia and the rest of the world.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239675/ishares-msci-philippines-etf">iShares ETF Philippines</a></p>
<h2>Thailand</h2>
<p>Not long ago, Thailand was in the list of undeveloped countries, as some of the countries listed in this article. However, since the 80&rsquo;s, its economy grew almost at a rate of 10%. This was until the financial crisis of 1997-1998 and 2007-2008. Ever, since the growth has been not that high, but still acceptable and better than the ones of countries in this region.</p>
<p>One of the obstacles is that Thailand has a military government and the instability has been a negative factor during the 21st century. On the other hand, the strategic plan for the next years, called Thailand 4.0, has put emphasis on the transformation of the country into a more modern country by focusing on hi-tech companies and services. In this new era, the technology and the private sector will play an important role in the country&rsquo;s digital transformation that will push and bolster the country&rsquo;s economy.</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/thailand.jpg" alt="Thailand">
<span class="caption text-muted">Despite the political instability, Thailand has a clear roadmap defined in Thailand 4.0</span>
</p>
<h2>China</h2>
<p>It should not be a surprise seeing China in this list. On the other hand, China was the second-worst performing emerging market in 2021. Some of the reasons are the regulations and isolation affecting some of the most important technology companies and other big conglomerates. The economic has grown more slowly in the past year, raising some alerts.</p>
<p>In the long term, one thing that is common knowledge is that the goal of China is to dominate the world economically. It is expected that China be the number 1 economy by 2030, overtaking USA. China may be facing some conflicts or obstacles that delay this forecast. However, China knows that they should remain prudent since they don&rsquo;t want to be the new hegemony over a devastated world.</p>
<p>They have the potential to do so in the upcoming years. Furthermore, while other developed countries were struggling, they have been using different techniques in the recent years: investment in high-tech, R&amp;D, purchase of debt from foreign countries, etc. There is no doubt China will be in the contenders list.</p>
<h3>ETF to invest in China</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.blackrock.com/cl/productos/239619/ishares-msci-china-etf">iShares ETF China&nbsp;</p>
<h2>India</h2>
<p>While different superpowers are engaged in different conflicts or crisis, the sleeping giant India remains silent.</p>
<p>With the economic policy changes introduced at the beginning of the 90s, India has been constantly growing every year. Furthermore, this growth is expected to continue at least for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>The growth is expected thanks to diverse factors such as population, urbanization, technology, private sector. For example, less than 10% of the companies are public. Another advantage compared to countries in this region is that India has inherited the British law system. This means, that regardless of the origin, all investors have the same rights - opposed for example to China -.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, although China is the most populated country today, there are some fertility issues in the Asian country. With this decrease in population in China and the increase in India, it is expected that India will be the most populated country in 30 years.</p>
<p>If the CEOs from the most important companies in the world are from Indian origin, why this cannot be replicated to the different companies in India?</p>

    Introduction
</h1>
<p>
    This is my first post in this blog, and I would like to address to a topic
    I may come back in the future to people without much time to analyse the
    different financial options for their future.
</p>
<p>
    Nowadays, the future economic outcome is a constant headache for many
    people across several countries: inflation, economic recovery, pensions,
    etc.
</p>
<p>
    There are many options out there for each type of investor: shares, bonds,
    real estate, crypto currencies, gold, etc. Each person has his preferences
    and depending on the age/risk-aversion different options can be multiple.
</p>
<p>
    More sophisticated investors are not discovering anything new about this
    story. If you continue reading, I am focusing on what I think is the best
    for most people, with the least possible risk: the indexed funds or
    exchange-traded funds.
</p>
<h1>
    Passive funds: Index funds &amp; Exchange Traded Fund
</h1>
<p>
    The behaviour for index funds and ETF is similar. Both replicate an index
    or basket of assets, meaning that with one single instrument you gain
    exposure to multiple securities (e.g., S&amp;P 500 companies). Between
    those, the main difference is that ETFs are traded in real-time, whereas
    the funds are just redeemed at the end of the day. The fees for the ETFs
    tend to be slightly lower too. On the other hand, they are subject to
    transaction fees, but many brokers offer transactions on the most popular
    ETFs for free.
</p>
<p>
    For a person without knowledge and looking for long-term returns, I am of
    the opinion of using a broad index and not a niche funds, which are focused
    a specific sector (e.g., eCommerce, video games, etc). Furthermore,
    although previous returns do not guarantee future returns, in the long-run
    most indexed funds outperform actively managed funds. The latter ones are
    famous for high fees, and although they may outperform passive funds in
    short periods, this is normally not the case in the long run. If you want
    to dig deeper, there are some formulas that determine the performance of
    the fund: For example: The Sharpe or Trentino ratio.
</p>
<p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/07.jpg" alt="Step by step">
<span class="caption text-muted">With the constant growth of fundd and the power of compounding you can get surprising results in the long run</span>
</p>
<h1>
    Some examples
</h1>
<p>
    Depending on your risk-aversion, you may choose different funds depending
    on the allocation. People near the retirement age should be more
    conservative. The way to do in this case is focusing on bond funds, which
    are less risky than equities.
</p>
<p>
    A famous rule is the “100 – age” rule. The result should be the amount of
    your portfolio invested on share funds. However, given the current
    situation, if you are young, there should not be problem on having a 100%
    equities asset location.
</p>
<p>
    Below, there is a list with the most famous ones for different profiles.
</p>
<h2>
    SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF Trust
</h2>
<p>
    Probably the most known ETF, which tracks the performance of the S&amp;P
    500 index. This is also the one with less expense ratio. It is considered
    one of the benchmarks.
</p>

</p>
<h2>
    Invesco QQQ Trust℠, Series 1
</h2>
<ul>
    <li align="center">
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This ETF tracks the Nasdaq 100 index (non-financial companies) and it is
    riskier than the SPDR. Taking into account the returns from the past 15
    years, it is the best performing large-cap growth funds.

</p>
<h2>
    Vanguard Global Stock
</h2>
<p>
    This fund tracks the MSCI World Index (around 1,500 shares). Almost 70% of
    the exposure of the fund is in the United States with almost 70% of the
    fund. The second largest market is Japan with around 6%.

</p>
<h2>
    Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Admiral Shares
</h2>
<p>
    For more conservative investors, we have this fund, which focuses on U.S.
    bonds (Treasuries and Mortgage-backed-securities). The returns are lower
    compared to the other 4 funds analyzed here, but it is also less risky.
</p>
<p>

        Vanguard Total Bond Market Information
    </a>
</p>
<h2>
    iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF
</h2>
<p>
    This is an ETF tracking the equities from companies located in Emerging
    markets (China, Brazil, India, etc.) For that reason, the fund is
    considered riskier than those included above. Furthermore, the expense
    ratio is also higher in these funds tracking shares from emerging markets.

</p>
<p>
    Please note that depending on the location, you may not be able to access
    some of these (e.g., most European investors do not have access to US
    funds). However, you should always be able to find similar funds to these.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the ones listed above are ETF or index funds, but you may always
    find the equivalent depending on your preferences. In these cases, the
    expense ratio is considerably low. The more specific you go (e.g. specific
    sector) the higher the expense ratio tends to be .In my case, my preference
    is the ETF because the expense ratios are slightly cheaper and you can
    track the price as in the case of shares.
</p>

</p>
<h1>Other details</h1>
<h2>
    The impact of currency
</h2>
<p>
    Although the USD has been dominating for many years, nobody knows when
    other contenders may appear. For the long-term, the recommendation would be
    to pick up an ETF or fund quoted in your local currency.
</p>
<h2>
    One-shot versus Dollar cost averaging
</h2>
<p>
    From my experience, the most dificult process is starting to invest, making
    sure that is it the right time. For this reason, although there are
    different studies showing that one-shot gives on average better results
    (time in the market beats timing the market), most people would not be
    comfortable dumping all the savings in one single transaction.
</p>
<p>
    For that reason, the Dollar Cost Averaging is the preferred method for
    common investors. By using this method, whatever happens in the market, you
    buy every month the same amount of units/shares of the chosen fund.
</p>
<h1>
    Tax implications
</h1>
<p>
    The way you are taxed on the returns from investment funds may have a huge
    impact. The main difference is whether the fund/ETF is an accumulation or
    distributing investment vehicle.
</p>
<p>
    In accumulation funds, the dividends received from the fund are reinvested.
    While this event is not seen as taxable for investors in many countries, it
    is seen as taxable for investors resident in countries such as Germany or
    Switzerland. Please consider that may be also other rules: For example, in
    Norway, the tax rate differs depending on whether the fund is an equity
    fund or a fixed-income fund. Therefore, please consider your situation in
    advance before choosing a specific fund.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, depending on the country you may want to look at what options are
    best for you. Furthermore, there are some tax-savings accounts in some
    countries that may be useful to make sure that you get benefited from the
    best product-
</p>
<p>
    Together with the expenses and commissions, taxes may be the most important
    factor eating your total returns. Imagine that you are paying 25% of tax in
    the dividends you receive. You are already not receiving this money, and
    more importantly, this amount is not used for the compounding, which
    reduced considerably the future value of the fund.
</p>
<p>

<h1>
    Where to start

    Now that we have seen the theory, it is time to jump into the action.
    Depending on the location you may have just access just to some brokers.
