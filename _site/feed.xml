<p>Mountain biking, a thrilling adventure sport, is rapidly gaining popularity among fitness enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies alike. The reason for this? There are many but one of the aspects that probably helped push this sport was the Covid pandemic and the lockdowns that we suffered.</p>

<p>With its combination of physical and mental challenges, breathtaking scenery, and the rush of adrenaline, mountain biking is a unique and exciting way to explore the great outdoors. In this essay, we will delve deeper into the world of mountain biking, examining its history, benefits, and techniques, and explore why it is such a popular activity for people of all ages and fitness levels.</p>

<p>Whether you are a seasoned mountain biker or just starting out, this article will provide valuable insights into this exhilarating sport.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-start">How to start</h2>

<p>If you are new or haven’t touched a bike since you were a teenager, getting started in mountain biking can be an exciting and rewarding experience. Here are some steps to help you get started:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Choose the right bike</strong>: Selecting the right mountain bike is crucial. There are several types of bikes available, including full-suspension, hardtail, and rigid. Consider your skill level, terrain you will be riding, and budget when selecting a bike.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety first</strong>: Safety should be your top priority when mountain biking. Invest in a good helmet, gloves, knee and elbow pads, and appropriate shoes. The wrong usage of clothes and accessories can make your ride uncomfortable or in the worst-case scenario, cause you some injuries.</li>
  <li><strong>Explore trails</strong>: Check out local mountain biking trails in your area. Start with beginner trails and work your way up as your skills improve. There are excellent applications and user suggestions out there and I’m sure you will find several in your area.</li>
  <li><strong>Take a class</strong>: This may not be needed but consider taking a mountain biking class or clinic to learn the basics of the sport, including proper body position, braking techniques, bike handling or shifting gears.</li>
  <li><strong>Practice makes perfect</strong>: Practice makes perfect, so take time to ride regularly and work on improving your skills. If you have not done it for some time, consider choosing an easy route the first time, better if you know most of it.</li>
  <li><strong>Ride with others</strong>: Join a local mountain biking group or club to ride with others and learn from more experienced riders. This will not make your routes just more fun, but they will.</li>
  <li><strong>Just have fun</strong>: That’s it. Mountain biking is an exciting and enjoyable sport, so remember to have fun and enjoy the ride. Most people practicing this sport are not there to compete, but just to enjoy themselves and the benefits. Talking about benefits, what are these?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>These are some advantages of this sport:</p>

<h3 id="cardiovascular-health">Cardiovascular health</h3>
<p>Mountain biking is an excellent form of cardiovascular exercise that can improve your heart and lung health, as well as your overall fitness level.</p>

<p>While other sports like running may be too harmful for some joins or bones, mountain biking makes avoid these negative consequences. Mountain biking is a low-impact exercise compared to running, which can be hard on your joints. MTB allows you to get a great cardio workout without putting excessive strain on your knees and other joints.</p>

<h3 id="strength-and-endurance">Strength and endurance</h3>

<p>Mountain biking is a great way to build strength and endurance, particularly in your lower body, including your legs, glutes, and core.</p>

<p>Compared to road cycling or jogging, MTB works many different muscles, including your quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, glutes, and core muscles. This can lead to increased muscle strength and tone, which can help improve your overall fitness. IF you notice the body type of mountain bikers, the body is more muscled. Please note that moving a 13/14 kg bike up and controlling while you descend puts of course your full body to work.
###</p>
<h3 id="weight-loss">Weight loss</h3>
<p>Regular mountain biking can help you burn calories and lose weight, especially if you combine it with a healthy diet. This can be a good exercise for people who don’t like cardio activities like jogging. Mountain biking makes the exercise not monotonous and lets you start progressively with no big effort. For example, you may just start with easy and almost flat routes. Thus, mountain biking offers endless opportunities to explore new trails and terrain. This can keep your workouts interesting and enjoyable.</p>
<h3 id="stress-relief">Stress relief</h3>
<p>A few months ago, we wrote an article regarding controlling stress. Mountain biking can be a great way to reduce stress and improve your mental well-being. Being out in nature and getting exercise can help you clear your mind and feel more relaxed. Therefore, this can be a great activity to disconnect. For example, longer routes in the weekends, and shorter routes during weekdays, in your lunch break.</p>

<h3 id="improved-balance-and-coordination">Improved balance and coordination</h3>
<p>Together with strength for your muscles Mountain biking requires a lot of balance and coordination, which can improve over time with regular practice. This is of course not just useful for cycling, but for other exercises that require great amount of coordination like swimming or dancing.</p>

<h3 id="social-connections">Social connections</h3>
<p>Mountain biking can be a social activity that allows you to connect with others who share your passion for the sport. It’s also a good activity to share past experiences, routes and tricks. Either in a group, with your work colleagues or with apps.</p>

<h3 id="nature-immersion">Nature immersion</h3>

<p>Mountain biking provides an opportunity to get out into nature and enjoy the beauty of natural landscapes, which can have a positive impact on your mood and overall well-being. As discussed, before it does not have benefit in your shape and physical benefit, but also helps you fight against one of the most growing diseases of the 21st century, stress.</p>

<p>If you like animals, it’s also fantastic to see different animals that you will never see close to urban areas.</p>

<h2 id="go-ahead-and-try-it">Go ahead and try it!</h2>

<p>In conclusion, mountain biking offers a wide range of benefits that make it an excellent choice for anyone looking for an exciting and challenging way to stay fit and explore the outdoors.</p>

<p>With its low-impact nature, ability to increase muscle strength and coordination, mental stimulation, variety, and opportunity to experience nature, it’s no wonder that mountain biking has become so popular in recent years.</p>

<p>Whether you’re looking for a solo adventure or a fun activity to share with friends and family, mountain biking is a thrilling and rewarding way to get outside and push your limits. So, grab your bike and hit the trails – you never know where this exhilarating sport might take you.</p>

<p>Of course, the rise of popularity had also some negative consequences. The most obvious one, skyrocketing prices for bikes and accessories and in several cases long queues when buying bikes. However, this is a point that we will discuss in the next article, including some tricks to look for alternative bikes and equipment.</p>]]></content><author><name>Javier Freire</name></author><category term="Sports" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mountain biking, a thrilling adventure sport, is rapidly gaining popularity among fitness enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies alike.

<p>It’s understandable that after a long day of work, the temptation to indulge in some tasty but unhealthy junk food can be strong.</p>

<p>However, it’s also common knowledge, that giving in to these temptations can have negative effects on both your body and mind.</p>

<p>Consuming excessive amounts of junk food can lead to weight gain, increased risk of chronic diseases, and a host of other health problems. Additionally, the high levels of sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats found in junk food can contribute to mood swings, fatigue, and decreased mental clarity.</p>

<p>However, in our society and with an easier access to different products, avoiding falling in the trap of junk food may be difficult. Fortunately, there are strategies you can use to avoid falling into the trap of junk food. By making small changes to your eating habits and lifestyle, you can cultivate healthier habits and avoid the negative consequences of consuming junk food.</p>

<h2 id="tricks-to-incorporate-on-your-diet">Tricks to incorporate on your diet</h2>

<h3 id="1-plan-your-meals">1. Plan your meals</h3>

<p>Plan your meals ahead of time, so you know what you will eat and when. This will help you avoid the temptation to grab something quick and unhealthy.</p>

<p>How to do this? You can for example choose one day of the week and define what the meal be on each day. Of course, there may be some days you are not home for some of the planned meals due to plans in the last time. One of the best times may be Sunday evening when you plan other things for the start to the week.</p>

<p>Depending on your objective, you can select and play with different ingredients to build the best options for you. Rely on classics or try new things and exotic food. It’s completely up to you.</p>

<h3 id="2-make-healthy-snacks-readily-available">2. Make healthy snacks readily available</h3>

<p>Keep healthy snacks, like fresh fruit, vegetables, and nuts, readily available so you can reach for them instead of junk food when hunger strikes.</p>

<p>It may look easy, but it is not. However, one trick is to have healthy snacks at hand and don’t wait to take a bit regardless of your hungriness. Having several of them during the day, does not just speed up your metabolism but also adds to the sensation of “satiety”.</p>

<h3 id="3-avoid-keeping-junk-food-in-the-house">3. Avoid keeping junk food in the house</h3>

<p>If you don’t have junk food in the house, you won’t be tempted to eat it. Instead, stock up on healthy foods that you enjoy.</p>

<p>If you cannot see it and you don’t have access to it, it’s not possible to. If you buy it for “just in case” it is likely that you will use fall in temptation. Therefore, the tip here is just don’t buy food that is unhealth for a future occasion. You will probably eat it tonight.</p>

<h3 id="4-choose-healthier-options-when-eating-out">4. Choose healthier options when eating out</h3>

<p>When eating out, choose healthier options, like salads, grilled chicken, and steamed vegetables, instead of fast food or fried foods.</p>

<p>This may be more difficult to do when seeing the choice of your companion in the restaurant. However, don’t use an excuse. If the dish in front of you looks very tasty, go of it instead of just regretting it. On the other hand, you may also compensate with healthier side dishes like salad instead of French fries for instance.</p>

<h3 id="5--moderation">5.  Moderation</h3>

<p>Nobody is perfect, not even the modern man-It’s okay to indulge in junk food occasionally, but it’s important to practice moderation. Enjoy your favorite treats in small portions and limit how often you eat them.</p>

<h3 id="6-balanced-meals">6. balanced meals</h3>

<p>Eating balanced meals that include a variety of nutrients will help keep you full and satisfied, reducing the temptation to snack on junk food.</p>

<p>Carbs are not the devil, same as fat. Having a combination of nutrients and mix of proteins, healthy fats and carbs (complex carbs) will help you with this task.</p>

<h3 id="7-read-food-labels">7. Read food labels</h3>

<p>Read the labels of packaged foods to check for added sugars, saturated and trans fats, and other unhealthy ingredients. Choose foods with fewer of these ingredients.</p>

<p>First rule of thumb is doesn’t rely on the appearance or the “envelope”. I said that you should read the labels to know what you eat, but this is not true, and it does not need to be that complex. There are some cool applications such as Yuka. They will tell you the score based on the nutrients and additives.</p>

<p>It will be also better to go for products without any QR code, which means that they are 100% natural products.</p>

<h3 id="8-drink-plenty-of-water">8. Drink plenty of water</h3>

<p>Drinking water can help curb your appetite and prevent you from reaching for junk food.</p>

<p>Aim to drink at least 8 cups of water per day. In summer, the amount of water also should in general increase, especially if you work out regularly.</p>

<h3 id="9-find-healthy-substitutes">9. Find healthy substitutes</h3>

<p>Instead of reaching for junk food, find healthy substitutes for your favorite snacks. These are some examples.</p>

<h3 id="healthy-substitutes">Healthy substitutes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Instead of potato chips, try baked sweet potato chips.</li>
  <li>Instead of ice cream, try frozen yogurt or a fruit smoothie.</li>
  <li>Instead of candy, try fresh fruit or a small handful of nuts.</li>
  <li>Instead of soda, try sparkling water with a splash of fruit juice or a herbal tea.</li>
  <li>Instead of crackers, try rice cakes or celery sticks with hummus.</li>
  <li>Instead of fried chicken, try grilled chicken breast or baked chicken nuggets.</li>
  <li>Instead of white bread, try whole grain bread or wraps.</li>
  <li>Instead of mayonnaise, try avocado or hummus as a spread.</li>
  <li>Instead of regular pasta, try zucchini noodles or spaghetti squash.</li>
  <li>Instead of sugary cereal, try oatmeal with fruit or a high-protein granola.</li>
  <li>Instead of popcorn, try air-popped popcorn or roasted chickpeas.</li>
  <li>Instead of French fries, try roasted sweet potato wedges or carrot fries.</li>
  <li>Instead of chocolate bars, try dark chocolate or chocolate-covered almonds.</li>
  <li>Instead of a bagel with cream cheese, try a whole grain English muffin with avocado or almond butter.</li>
  <li>Instead of a muffin, try a homemade oatmeal muffin or a protein bar.</li>
  <li>Instead of a sugary sports drink, try coconut water or infused water with fresh fruit.</li>
  <li>Instead of a milkshake, try a protein shake or a smoothie bowl.</li>
  <li>Instead of store-bought granola bars, try homemade granola bars or energy balls.</li>
  <li>Instead of fried chips, try baked beet chips or kale chips.</li>
  <li>Instead of a breakfast sandwich, try a veggie omelet with whole grain toast or a breakfast burrito with a whole grain tortilla.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="10-practice-mindful-eating">10. Practice mindful eating</h3>

<p>Pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues and eat slowly, savoring each bite. This can help prevent overeating and reduce cravings for unhealthy foods. This may be the most difficult of all the items in the list.</p>

<p>Before eating, take a few deep breaths to help you relax and become present in the moment. Don’t eat because of anxiety of boredom.</p>

<p>Notice your hunger level on a scale of 1-10. Aim to start eating when you are at a 3-4, and stop eating when you are at a 6-7.</p>

<p>Take small bites and chew your food slowly, savoring the taste, texture, and aroma of each bite.</p>

<p>Avoid distractions such as watching TV, using your phone, or working while you eat. Instead, focus on the experience of eating and the enjoyment of the food. This way, Put down your utensils or food between bites, and take a few moments to check in with your body and assess your hunger level. These steps Will make you conscious of the activity and eat just what you need.</p>

<h2 id="starting-it-progressively">Starting it progressively</h2>

<p>Probably some of these tricks are already known to you and you don’t need to start from scratch.</p>

<p>Starting gradually and making small changes over time is a great way to achieve long-term success with healthy eating habits. It’s important to remember that making healthy choices is a journey, not a destination, and it’s okay to start small and work your way up.</p>

<p>Don’t be discouraged if you slip up and indulge in unhealthy foods from time to time. Instead, focus on progress rather than perfection, and make a conscious effort to get back on track with your healthy eating habits as soon as possible.</p>

<p>By taking a gradual approach to healthy eating, you can make sustainable changes that will benefit your overall health and well-being. And remember, the benefits of healthy eating go beyond just physical health - feeling good about yourself can have a positive impact on all areas of your life, from work to relationships to daily activities.</p>

<p>Making lasting changes to your eating habits can take time and patience, but the benefits are well worth the effort. By starting small and gradually incorporating healthier choices into your diet, you can build momentum and create a sustainable healthy lifestyle.</p>

<p>It’s important to approach healthy eating as a journey, rather than a quick fix or a temporary diet. This mindset can help you stay motivated and committed to making long-term changes that will benefit your overall health and well-being.</p>

<p>Remember, healthy eating is not about deprivation or perfection. It’s about finding a balance that works for you and your body, and making conscious choices that support your health and happiness. So be kind to yourself, celebrate your progress, and keep moving forward towards a healthier, happier you.</p>]]></content><author><name>Javier Freire</name></author><category term="Health" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The importance of making conscious, healthy choices in our daily lives.

<p>A few months ago, we discussed the most important changes that the Ethereum Merge would bring and in fact delivered to the users. With this change, as you know, the most significant change was that the “old” Proof of Work was replaced by the Proof of Stake Protocol.</p>

<p>These are basically the most important changes that are possible now thanks to the Merge.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Improved energy efficiency: PoS uses less energy compared to PoW, which is expected to significantly reduce Ethereum’s carbon footprint.</li>
  <li>Increased scalability: The merge made the Ethereum network more scalable, as PoS can process more transactions per second compared to PoW.</li>
  <li>Enhanced security: PoS is designed to prevent 51% attacks, which are a significant concern with PoW consensus mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Changes to the mining ecosystem: The merge eliminated the need for miners, as PoS relies on validators who stake their ETH to secure the network.</li>
  <li>EIP-1559 integration: The upgrade included integration of EIP-1559, which introduced a new fee structure for Ethereum transactions, making the network more user-friendly.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="from-london-to">From London to…</h2>

<p>However, these changed had not been possible without the fork that occurred the year before. Back in 2021, this network change, also known as the London upgrade, made the following modifications in the Ethereum network.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>EIP-1559</strong>: This change introduced a new transaction pricing mechanism that aims to improve the predictability and transparency of Ethereum gas fees, which can often be unpredictable and volatile. It also burned a portion of the fees collected, which reduces the overall supply of Ethereum, potentially increasing its value.</li>
  <li><strong>EIP-3198</strong>: This change reduces the gas cost of certain types of transactions, making them cheaper for users.</li>
  <li><strong>EIP-3529</strong>: This change increased the difficulty of certain types of DDOS attacks that can slow down or crash the Ethereum network.</li>
  <li><strong>EIP-3541</strong>: This change prepared the network for the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, seen above, by removing certain features that will no longer be needed.</li>
</ol>

<p>These implementations caused them to make the network more energy-efficient, secure, and scalable, while also changing the mining ecosystem and introducing new fee structures. However, as also announced in the Merge, this is not over, and the Ethereum Foundation never stops with the continuous improvements.</p>

<p>Having listed it several EIP, it may seem that there are no enhancements left for do in the Ethereum. Nonetheless, this is quite far from reality and if you to the Ethereum Improvement Proposals website you will see more and more suggestions.</p>

<h2 id="shanghai">Shanghai</h2>

<p>So now, with all the background and knowing the most important changes occurred in the last 2 years explained, let’s focus on the Shanghai upgrade.</p>

<h2 id="5-new-eip-coming">5 New EIP Coming</h2>

<p>Even if the Merge was the big upgrade, there are 5 EIP expected to come in a few weeks from now. When? It’s expected that these changes may pop up around mid-March. However, based on the experience with previous integrations, it will not be surprising that this fork in the network is slightly delayed.</p>

<p>The upgrade of Ethereum, also known as the Ethereum Shanghai fork, will implement five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), and compared to the previous forks, there are several changes related to the fees.</p>

<h3 id="eip-4895">EIP-4895</h3>

<p>Out of these five proposals, EIP-4895 is expected to receive the most attention. The upgrade will allow Ethereum investors to withdraw their staked ETH for the first time since December 2020. This lock was needed in order to use this as validation mechanism and protect the network.</p>

<p>Some of the fears that this had raised is that there may be a lot of withdrawals when this change becomes effective. However, because of some withdrawal caps and other rewards- higher staking -, it’s unlikely that we will see massive withdrawals.</p>

<p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895</a></p>

<h3 id="eip-3855">EIP-3855</h3>

<p>At the moment, the EVM does not have a PUSH0 instruction, and the goal will be to reduce the gas consumption by introduction this instruction in the virtual machine.</p>

<p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855</a></p>

<h2 id="eip-3860">EIP-3860</h2>

<p>EIP-3860 is an extension of the old EIP-170 and seeks to lower transaction costs for developers when interacting with smart contracts.</p>

<p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860</a></p>

<h3 id="eip-3651">EIP-3651</h3>

<p>To execute transactions in the network, it is necessary to interact with the Coinbase machine – nothing to do with the Exchange - several times. The initial interaction requires a higher fee as the software needs to “warm up,” but as interactions increase, fees decrease.</p>

<p>This proposal will ensure that the Coinbase software remains “warm”, resulting in a reduced gas fee to access it.</p>

<p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3651">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3651</a></p>

<h3 id="eip-6049">EIP-6049</h3>

<p>EIP-6049 is a notification mechanism to developers regarding code known as “SELFDESTRUCT that aims to reduce gas fees.</p>

<p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6049">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6049</a></p>

<h2 id="what-after-shanghai">What after Shanghai?</h2>

<p>These upgrades should improve network usage in DeFi and NFTs. Even the initiator of them, some detractors complained that high gas fees and slow transactions affected some of these ecosystems.</p>

<p>With these improvements, old and new projects may consider Ethereum more favorably, which was losing momentum to newer and chains with lower fees.</p>

<p>Greater flexibility in staking, better performance, and an increase in stakeholders could amplify the resulting network effect sand benefit all stakeholders (users, investors, etc.) in the long run.</p>

<p>The objective of these changes is not just to continue improving the Ethereum performance, but also try to reduce the churn of some DeFi or NFT projects to more affordable networks such as Polygon or Solana, like we have seen in marketplaces like OpenSea or other applications in the last years.</p>

<p>As consequences of part Blockchain Trilemma, Ethereum has been plagued with sluggish transactions and high fees, which became more evident during the decentralized finance boom a few years ago.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the trend of minting them in 2021 and early 2022 added to poor user experiences and high gas fees. These EIPs are mainly focused on this topic. Their aim to help mitigate these problems and convince users that Ethereum is the best network for the different projects and dApps.</p>

<p>As we have seen, this will not be the end, and this is just the follow-up to get a more scalable network. This will be achieved when features such sharding are included in the chain in a few months from now.</p>

<p>Achieving sharding will be crucial for enhancing transaction throughput on the chain by enabling “parallel processing.” The implementation of sharding is expected to occur in two stages in 2023 and 2024.</p>

<p>Although small change compared to the PoW – PoS migration occurred in 2022, this upgrade makes sure that Ethereum, one of the oldest blockchains, keeps up good progress and for sure will convince old and new users of the chain.</p>]]></content><author><name>Javier Freire</name></author><category term="Crypto" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After London, and the Merge, the Ethereum network is preparing for the next big upgrade.

<div class="text-article">

Today in the afternoon, I received an email from INSEAD announcing that they are offering a new specialization called Web3 and Blockchain in Global Commerce Specialization. I received this message in my mailbox, I guess because I took several courses from INSEAD related to Blockchain in the past.



</div>

<p>I did not have the chance to go in detail about this specialization, but it sounds interesting to learn new concepts and refresh the ones I learned a few years ago. I also thought that it could be relevant to other people sharing my experience with other courses.</p>

<p>This post is not about this specialization and I will describe more about it when I complete it. Nonetheless, this purpose of this article is to show the readers that even if it’s sometimes not easy to start into the Blockchain world and industries, there are several resources out there that can help you in this mission. We already saw of these resources in another post, so this post will talk mainly about more traditional courses that I enjoyed.</p>

<h2 id="blockchain-revolution">Blockchain Revolution</h2>

<h3 id="organization-insead">Organization: INSEAD</h3>

<p>The Blockchain Revolution course on Coursera is an in-depth exploration of the concepts, applications, and implications of blockchain technology. The course is taught by Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott in collaboration with INSEAD. Both both well-known experts in the field of blockchain and the course is now several years old. The new specialization of the introduction is also taught by the father and his son.</p>

<p>The course is divided into several modules, each of which covers a different aspect of blockchain technology. The first module introduces the basic concepts of blockchain and provides an overview of how it works.</p>

<p>The second one delves deeper into the technical aspects of blockchain, including the various types of consensus algorithms and the role of cryptography in securing blockchain networks.</p>

<p>The third module explores the various applications of blockchain technology, including its potential use in finance, supply chain management, and digital identity verification. The fourth module looks at the potential societal impact of blockchain, including its potential to disrupt traditional power structures and create new economic opportunities.</p>

<p>The fifth module focuses on the practical aspects of building and deploying blockchain solutions, including how to design a blockchain network, select the right consensus algorithm, and ensure security and scalability.</p>

<p>The final module of the course explores the future of blockchain technology, including emerging trends and the potential impact of blockchain on various industries. It’s here where the student can put all the learned lessons to work and create a project that will need to submit.</p>

<p>In these courses, the instructors use real-world examples and case studies to illustrate the potential of blockchain technology. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of how blockchain works, its potential applications, and the implications of this technology for businesses, governments, and society as a whole.</p>

<p>If this course was not enough, there is a similar specialization also taught by the Tapscott family and INSEAD. This one comes next in our list.</p>

<div class="text-article">
Despite facing numerous obstacles in 2022, emerging market equities began to show signs of recovery in the last quarter of 2022. This trend is expected to continue during 2023 due to factors such as robust growth, declining inflation, a softening US dollar, and favorable fundamentals.

</div>

<p>In light of the widespread decline in equity markets during 2022, emerging market equities are believed to be one of the most undervalued asset classes, offering attractive valuations compared to historical norms. Just have a look at some metrics such as the Price Earnings Ratio and it is one of the most attractive ones in recent years.</p>

<p>When it comes to bonds, the outlook for emerging market debt, which faced a difficult landscape in 2022, is now considered to be more positive. The combination of high yields, favorable valuations, and a supportive global environment, including the potential for growth in China, creates the opportunity for equity-like returns in the mid-teens over the next year in both hard and local currency debt.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened-recently">What happened recently?</h2>

<p>But before we start, what happened when back in 2020, we expected emerging markets such as China to be the clear winners of the COVID pandemic?</p>

<p>In 2022, the MSCI EM Index experienced a decline of around 20%. When all the spotlights were on China, they heavily disappointed last year. Other BRIC countries such as Russia did not help either. Korea – although just considered as Emerging for the MSCI index and not in the FTSE index -</p>

<p>This focus on innovation and growth trends can have a significant impact on investment performance. In 2021, the MSCI EM ex-China Index outperformed the MSCI China Index by a margin of 32 percentage points, showcasing the benefits of<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> actively </code>targeting emerging market equities. Regions such as Argentina, India, or Turkey had something to do with this performance.</p>

<p>However, as said, we have seen some signs of improvements in the last weeks. In the last quarter of the year, the asset class saw a resurgence, rising by nearly 10% as a result of China’s efforts to reopen its economy and support for the real estate sector to reignite economic growth. In terms of sector performance, communication services performed the best, followed by health care, materials, and real estate. Furthermore, there were some indices such as the Turkish or Argentinian ones that achieved<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> excellent </code>results, even if their local currency devaluated even more.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, energy, utilities, and consumer staples lagged behind the index during the quarter. The strong recovery seen in the fourth quarter of 2022 bodes well for the future of emerging market equities in 2023. Let’s take a closer look at some of the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> key </code>factors that will drive growth in the coming year.</p>

<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/emerging_markets_2025/machu.jpeg" alt="Hidden secrets" />
    <span class="caption text-muted">Some Latin American countries can be the next hidden gem, considering that they have been reviled for some time </span>
</p>

<p>Despite facing difficulties in 2021 and 2022, such as slow vaccine distribution and the emergence of the Delta variant, there is potential for a rebound in emerging market (EM) economies. However, risks still persist. A potential catalyst for recovery could be a rise in interest rates, which is expected to bring developed-market GDP back to its trend line.</p>

<p>An<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> active </code>strategy in emerging market (EM) equities has the potential to outperform a US equity strategy in the next decade, as populations in EM countries grow and innovation continues to expand. The equity valuations in EM markets are relatively attractive, and earnings growth is currently at a decade-high. The region is home to many of the world’s top-performing companies, but these firms may not be included in standard benchmarks, which tend to heavily weight state-owned enterprises and industries that rely on exports. An<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> active </code>investment approach can provide investors with greater exposure to companies that are experiencing growth driven by secular trends.</p>

<h2 id="long-term-vision">Long-term vision</h2>

<p>Emerging markets are set to play a significant role in the global economy not just until 2025, but in the next decade. Despite facing challenges such as economic instability, political unrest, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, these markets have shown remarkable resilience and are poised for growth in the coming years.</p>

<p>One of the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> key </code>drivers of growth in emerging markets is their rapidly growing populations, which provide a large pool of consumers for both local and foreign businesses.</p>

<p>This, combined with increasing urbanization, rising incomes, and growing middle classes, creates a favourable environment for investment.</p>

<p>Another factor contributing to the growth of emerging markets is technological advancements, particularly in the areas of digital infrastructure, e-commerce, and fintech. This is providing new opportunities for businesses to reach customers and drive innovation in these markets.</p>

<p>In 2023 and 2024, some of the top emerging markets to watch include China, India, Brazil, Russia, and South Africa. These countries offer a diverse range of investment opportunities across various industries, including technology, healthcare, and infrastructure. The astonishing returns that occurred in the Turkish and Argentinian indices are not expected to continue in 2023.</p>

<p>China, with its large and growing middle class, is expected to continue to drive growth in Asia, while India is poised to become a major player in the global economy, thanks to its large and youthful population. In South America, the 2 big players, Brazil and Argentina, are set to benefit from a rebound in commodities prices and increased investment in infrastructure.</p>

<p>Russia, meanwhile, is poised to benefit from a recovering oil market, while South Africa is expected to see growth driven by its mineral resources, including gold and platinum.</p>

<p>You may have a look at some of these countries in this <a href="https://mrfreire.net/top-emerging-countries-2022/">article</a></p>

<h2 id="beware-of-the-risks">Beware of the risks</h2>

<p>However, while emerging markets offer significant opportunities, they also come with risks. Political and economic instability, currency fluctuations, and regulatory challenges are among the risks that investors must consider when investing in these markets.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, emerging markets are expected to continue to play an increasingly important role in the global economy over the next two years. With the right investment strategy, they offer the potential for high returns, while also helping to diversify portfolios and mitigate risk.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the next years are set to be exciting years for emerging markets, with opportunities for growth and investment in a range of industries. The prices we see are very attractive as entry level.</p>

<h2 id="research-and-where-to-start">Research and where to start</h2>

<p>As always, careful research and a well-considered investment strategy will be<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> key </code>to realizing the full potential of these dynamic and rapidly growing markets. However, instead of cherry-picking stocks, the best solution for most of us would be and index in order to collect returns from all countries.</p>

<div class="text-article">
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the` potential `to revolutionize the way we work and improve` productivity `across various industries. In the software development industry, AI is already being used to improve` productivity `in several ways.</div>

<p>One of the most common ways AI is being used to improve software<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>is through the use of code completion tools. These tools use AI algorithms to suggest code snippets or complete entire lines of code based on the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> context </code>of the current project. This can save developers a significant amount of time and effort by reducing the need for manual coding. Some examples of code completion tools include DeepTabNine, Kite, and TabNine.</p>

<p>Coding is a complex and time-consuming task that requires a lot of focus and attention to detail. However, there are many tools available that can help you improve your<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>and streamline your workflow. In this article, we will discuss some of the most popular tools that you can use to improve your coding productivity.</p>

<p>There are different ways to increase what we do in less time. IDEs, project management tools and methodologies or automations tools and some of these examples. Probably some of these improvements can also come from non-technology methods, but improving our lifestyle, focus and nutrition.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we will leave them for another time. Today we are going to discuss what AI can do in terms of efficiency. We are going to show two of the benefits of using them in our daily life. For this article, we will focus of one of the state-of-the-art tools, both of them powered by the OpenAI codex.</p>

<h2 id="github-copilot">GitHub Copilot</h2>

<p>Starting with Microsoft, GitHub Copilot is a powerful AI-powered code completion<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> tool </code>that allows developers to write code more efficiently and with fewer errors. This powerful<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> tool </code>can help developers to increase their<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>by reducing the time it takes to complete repetitive or complex tasks.</p>

<p>One of the main features of GitHub Copilot is its ability to provide code<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> suggestions </code>as developers type. This can help to save time by eliminating the need to manually search for the correct syntax or function. Additionally, Copilot also provides context-aware suggestions, which means that it can suggest different options based on the specific<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> context </code>of the code.</p>

<p>Another useful feature of GitHub Copilot is its ability to automatically fix common coding errors. This can save developers a significant amount of time, as they no longer need to spend time searching for and fixing errors. Additionally, Copilot can also help to improve code quality by suggesting improvements and best practices.</p>

<p>In addition to these features, GitHub Copilot also offers advanced functionality such as code refactoring, which can help developers to simplify and improve their code. This can be particularly useful when working on large and complex projects, as it can help to make the code more maintainable.</p>

<p>To use GitHub Copilot, developers need to have a GitHub account and the GitHub extension for IntelliJ,Pycharm, Visual Studio Code or your favorite IDE . Once the extension is installed, developers can start using Copilot by opening a new file or by hovering over a function or variable.</p>

<h2 id="chatgpt">ChatGPT</h2>

<p>ChatGPT is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI that can be used to increase coding productivity. It is a state-of-the-art machine learning model that can be used to generate code, complete code snippets, and even write entire programs.</p>

<p>One of the main benefits of using ChatGPT for coding is its ability to generate code quickly and accurately. With ChatGPT, developers no longer have to spend hours writing code from scratch or searching through documentation to find the right syntax. Instead, they can simply provide ChatGPT with a brief description of what they want to accomplish, and the model will generate the necessary code.</p>

<p>Another benefit of using ChatGPT for coding is its ability to learn from existing code. The model can analyze existing code and use that knowledge to generate new code that is consistent with the existing style and structure. This means that developers no longer have to spend time trying to conform to a specific coding style, as ChatGPT can automatically generate code that follows the style of the existing codebase.</p>

<p>Additionally, ChatGPT can also assist in code refactoring and bug fixing. It can analyze the code, find bugs and suggest fixes, or even generate the fix itself. This can save a lot of time and effort for developers who would otherwise have to manually scan through the code to find and fix bugs.</p>

<p>Another great feature of ChatGPT is its ability to write comments and documentation. This can be extremely helpful for developers who are working on complex projects and need to document their work. ChatGPT can analyze the code and generate comments and documentation that explain what the code is doing and how it works.</p>

<p>Furthermore, ChatGPT is a powerful<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> tool </code>that can be used to increase coding<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>in several ways. It can generate code quickly and accurately, learn from existing code, assist in code refactoring and bug fixing, write comments and documentation, and even generate entire programs. By incorporating ChatGPT into their workflow, developers can save time and effort while also improving the quality of their work.</p>

<p>On another hand, ChatGPT also has the ability to generate entire programs. It can take a high-level description of what the program should do and generate the entire codebase for it. This can be especially useful for developers who are working on proof-of-concepts or prototypes.</p>

<p>Of course, ChatGPT is no error-proof and due to the stored data, it could be the case that some code or libraries are old and/or deprecated. However, when writing one of the generated errors triggered in suggested blocks of code, ChatGPT will apologize for that and suggest new changes that will work. This is some of the situations several people have encountered. Once Microsoft complete the acquisition and ChatGPT has access to real time data, we will see what this<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> tool </code>is capable of.</p>

<p>We have seen that GitHub Copilot is a powerful<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> tool </code>that can help developers to increase their<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>by reducing the time it takes to complete repetitive or complex tasks. With its ability to provide code suggestions, automatically fix common coding errors and suggest improvements, Copilot can help developers to improve the quality of their code and increase their efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="a-lot-of-new-things-to-come">A lot of new things to come</h2>

<p>All of these features combined can greatly increase coding<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>and help developers focus on the more important aspects of their work such as designing and implementing new features, and solving complex problems.</p>

<p>To conclude with this short article AI is already being used to improve software<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>in several ways, and it is likely that its use will continue to expand in the future. By automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, AI can help developers to focus on more complex and creative tasks, ultimately leading to better software and more efficient development processes.</p>

<p>We are still on very early stages of the AI revolution.

<div class="text-article">
Nomad work refers to a type of work that is not tied to a specific location or office, and can be done from anywhere in
the world with an internet connection. This type of work is becoming increasingly popular as more and more people are
able to take advantage of the flexibility and freedom that it offers. Besides, more and more companies are embracing
remote work and the use of technology makes it easier to stay connected and productive from any location.</div>

<p>Working from anywhere refers to the ability to do your job from any location, as long as you have access to the
necessary tools and resources. popular as the use of technology makes it easier to stay connected and productive from
any location.</p>

<p>If you don’t like monotony, who would not be willing to work while skiing in the Italian Alps, sunbathing in the Spanish
Canary Islands or diving in the exotic Bali?</p>

<h2 id="how-to-do-it">How to do it</h2>

<p>There are different types of nomad work, including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remote work</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">freelancing</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">digital nomadism</code>. Remote work
refers to any type of work that is done remotely, usually from home or a coworking space. Freelancing refers to working
as a self-employed individual, offering services to clients on a project-by-project basis. Digital nomadism is a
specific type of nomad work that involves traveling the world while working remotely.</p>

<p>One of the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> main </code>benefits of nomad work is the flexibility it offers. Instead of being tied to a specific location or
office, nomad workers have the freedom to choose where they want to work from. This allows them to work from home, a
coffee shop, a coworking space, or even from a different country.</p>

<p>Another benefit of working remotely is the ability to choose your own schedule. Many nomad workers have the freedom to
set their own schedule and work when it is convenient for them. This can be especially beneficial for those with
children or other responsibilities that make it difficult to work a traditional 9-5 job.</p>

<p>Nomad work also allows for a better work-life balance. Since nomad workers are not tied to a specific location, they
have the ability to travel and<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> experience </code>new cultures while still being able to work. This can be a great way to see
the world and have new experiences while still making a living.</p>

<p>However, nomad work is not for everyone. It can be challenging to stay motivated and focused when you are working from
home or a coworking space, and it can be difficult to build a professional network when you are constantly on the move.
It is also important to be self-disciplined and organized when working as a nomad, as there may not be the same level of
structure and oversight as there is in a traditional office setting.</p>

<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/nomad/japan.jpeg" alt="Travel more, discover new things" />
    <span class="caption text-muted">Having the benefit or chance of working from anywhere is a great opportunity to discover new countries and cultures. Maybe after that visit you would like to relocate this new place</span>
</p>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<p>These are some tips to help you when changing your mind and embracing this new lifestyle:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Determine your work needs: Consider what type of work you do and what resources you need in order to be productive.
This will help you determine the best location for your nomad work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find a reliable internet connection: A strong and stable internet connection is essential for nomad work, so make
sure you have access to one<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> wherever </code>you go.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set boundaries: It can be easy to get caught up in work when you are a nomad, so it is important to set boundaries
and make sure you take breaks and have a healthy work-life balance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stay organized: Nomad work can be disorganized at times, so it is important to have systems in place to keep track of
your work and stay on top of tasks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find a community: It can be lonely working as a nomad, so it is important to find a community of like-minded
individuals who can provide support and connection. This can be through online groups or by joining a coworking
space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plan for the future: Nomad work is not for everyone, and it is important to have a plan in place for the future in
case you decide to transition back to a more traditional work arrangement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protect your finances: Nomad work can be unpredictable, so it is important to have a financial safety net in place to
protect yourself in case of unexpected expenses or income fluctuations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stay in touch with home: Working abroad can be exciting, but it can also be homesickness. Make sure to stay in touch
with friends and family back home and keep them updated on your adventures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find temporary housing: If you will be working in a country for an extended period of time, it is a good idea to find
temporary housing rather than staying in a hotel. This can be more cost-effective and will also allow you to get a
better feel for local life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take care of your physical and mental health: It is important to prioritize your physical and mental health when you
   are a nomad, as it can be easy to neglect self-care when you are constantly on the move.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, nomad work offers many benefits, including flexibility, freedom, and the ability to choose your own schedule
and work from anywhere. However, it is not for everyone, and it is important to carefully consider whether it is the
right fit for you before making the decision to become a nomad worker.</p>

<p>Employees who are can enjoy working from anywhere may have more flexibility in their schedules, which can be especially
beneficial for those who have non-traditional work schedules or who may have difficulty taking time off due to family or
other commitments.</p>

<p>This aspect does not just benefit the employee, but the enterprise. Employees who have this type of flexibility are also
able to work more hours, be more creative and more productive. Furthermore, taking<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> holidays </code>should not be the only time
we have to visit other countries or regions.</p>

<p>Is the shift to remote work a temporary trend caused by the latest pandemic or a permanent change in the way we do
business? I think the last one, and I also have the opinion that still a lot of<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> corporations </code>have still to discover this
range of possibilities. Let’s hope I’m right about this last thought.</p>]]></content><author><name>Javier Freire</name></author><category term="Work" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How working remotely can benefit you and your employer.

<div class="text-article">
What’s deep work and why you are hearing more and more this term? Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction
on a cognitively demanding task. It is a state of flow in which you are fully immersed in the task at hand and able to
produce high-quality work in a short amount of time. There are several` benefits `to practicing deep work.
</div>

<p>Deep work is a term coined by productivity expert and author Cal Newport to describe the state of intense focus and
concentration on a cognitively demanding task. In today’s world, where we are constantly bombarded with distractions and
notifications from our smartphones and computers, it can be difficult to achieve this state of deep work. However,
learning to<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> engage </code>in deep work can have significant<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> benefits </code>for our productivity and creativity.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>One of the key<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> benefits </code>of deep work is that it allows us to produce high-quality work in less time. When we are able to
focus intensely on a task without distractions, our brains are able to work more efficiently and we can make faster
progress. This is especially important in the age of information overload, where we often have a large amount of work to
do and limited time to do it.</p>

<p>In addition to being more efficient, deep work can also lead to higher-quality results. When we are able to focus deeply
on a task, we are able to think more critically and creatively, and this can result in better ideas and solutions. This
is especially important in fields that require a high level of creativity and problem-solving, such as research,
writing, and software development.</p>

<p>Although this may seem easy, different<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> factors </code>can affect our life.</p>

<p>achieving deep work is not always easy. In order to<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> engage </code>in deep work, we need to be able to eliminate distractions
and create an environment that is conducive to focus and concentration. This can involve setting aside dedicated blocks
of time for deep work, finding a quiet and comfortable place to work, and<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> using </code>tools and techniques to block out
distractions.</p>

<p>For example, some people find it helpful to use a Pomodoro timer to break their work into focused 25-minute intervals,
with short breaks in between. Others use noise-cancelling headphones or ambient noise apps to block out background noise
and help them concentrate. Some people even go to extreme lengths, such as disconnecting from the internet or working in
a secluded cabin in the woods, to create the optimal conditions for deep work.</p>

<p>There are several<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> benefits </code>of engaging in deep work:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Increased productivity: Deep work allows us to produce high-quality work in less time. When we are able to focus
intensely on a task without distractions, our brains are able to work more efficiently and we can make faster

that we might not have come up with otherwise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment: Finally, engaging in deep work can give us a greater sense of

<div class="text-article">
Trail running is a form of off-road running that takes place on hiking trails, dirt paths, and other natural terrain. It
is a popular outdoor activity that allows runners to explore the beauty of nature while also challenging themselves
physically and mentally.</div>

<p>One of the main benefits of trail running is the variety of scenery that it offers. Unlike road running, which often
takes place on dull, monotonous stretches of pavement, trail running allows runners to experience the beauty of forests,
mountains, and other natural environments. This can provide a much-needed change of scenery for runners who are used to
running on roads, and it can make the activity more enjoyable and stimulating.</p>

<p>In addition to the beautiful scenery, trail running also offers a number of physical and mental benefits. Running on
natural terrain can be more challenging than running on pavement, as it often involves steep hills, uneven surfaces, and
other obstacles. This can provide a more intense workout and help to improve a runner’s strength, endurance, and overall
fitness level.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>Trail running can also be a great way to reduce stress and improve mental health. Being outdoors in nature has been
shown to have a calming effect on the mind, and the physical exertion of running can help to release endorphins and
other feel-good chemicals in the brain. As a result, many people find that trail running helps them to relax, de-stress,
and feel more positive and energized.</p>

<p>To get started with trail running, it is<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> important </code>to have the right equipment. In addition to a good pair of running
shoes, it is also a good idea to invest in some other gear that is designed specifically for trail running. This can
include items such as a hydration<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> pack </code>or water bottle, trail running gaiters, and a hat or visor to protect your eyes
from the sun.</p>

<p>It is also<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> important </code>to choose a trail that is appropriate for your skill level. Beginners should start with easy,
well-maintained trails, and gradually work their way up to more challenging terrain as they become more experienced. It

<p>There are many benefits to trail running, including:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Beautiful scenery: Unlike road running, which often takes place on dull, monotonous stretches of pavement, trail
running allows runners to experience the beauty of forests, mountains, and other natural environments. This can
provide a much-needed change of scenery and make the activity more enjoyable and stimulating.</li>
  <li>Increased physical challenge: Running on natural terrain can be more challenging than running on pavement, as it
often involves steep hills, uneven surfaces, and other obstacles. This can provide a more intense workout and help to
improve a runner’s strength, endurance, and overall fitness level.</li>
  <li>Mental health benefits: Being outdoors in nature has been shown to have a calming effect on the mind, and the
physical exertion of running can help to release endorphins and other feel-good chemicals in the brain. As a result,
many people find that trail running helps them to reduce stress, improve their mood, and feel more positive and
energized.</li>
  <li>Improved coordination and balance: Trail running requires a higher level of coordination and balance than road
running, as runners must navigate uneven terrain and avoid obstacles. This can help to improve a runner’s overall
balance and coordination, and reduce the risk of falls and injuries.</li>
  <li>Social interaction: Many people find that trail running is a great way to meet new people and make friends who share
their<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> love </code>of the outdoors. Running with a buddy or in a group can provide additional support, motivation, and a
sense of community.</li>
