<div class="text-article">
Despite facing numerous obstacles in 2022, emerging market equities began to show signs of recovery in the last quarter of 2022. This trend is expected to continue during 2023 due to factors such as robust growth, declining inflation, a softening US dollar, and favorable fundamentals.

</div>

<p>In light of the widespread decline in equity markets during 2022, emerging market equities are believed to be one of the most undervalued asset classes, offering attractive valuations compared to historical norms. Just have a look at some metrics such as the Price Earnings Ratio and it is one of the most attractive ones in recent years.</p>

<p>When it comes to bonds, the outlook for emerging market debt, which faced a difficult landscape in 2022, is now considered to be more positive. The combination of high yields, favorable valuations, and a supportive global environment, including the potential for growth in China, creates the opportunity for equity-like returns in the mid-teens over the next year in both hard and local currency debt.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened-recently">What happened recently?</h2>

<p>But before we start, what happened when back in 2020, we expected emerging markets such as China to be the clear winners of the COVID pandemic?</p>

<p>In 2022, the MSCI EM Index experienced a decline of around 20%. When all the spotlights were on China, they heavily disappointed last year. Other BRIC countries such as Russia did not help either. Korea – although just considered as Emerging for the MSCI index and not in the FTSE index -</p>

<p>This focus on innovation and growth trends can have a significant impact on investment performance. In 2021, the MSCI EM ex-China Index outperformed the MSCI China Index by a margin of 32 percentage points, showcasing the benefits of<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> actively </code>targeting emerging market equities. Regions such as Argentina, India, or Turkey had something to do with this performance.</p>

<p>However, as said, we have seen some signs of improvements in the last weeks. In the last quarter of the year, the asset class saw a resurgence, rising by nearly 10% as a result of China’s efforts to reopen its economy and support for the real estate sector to reignite economic growth. In terms of sector performance, communication services performed the best, followed by health care, materials, and real estate. Furthermore, there were some indices such as the Turkish or Argentinian ones that achieved<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> excellent </code>results, even if their local currency devaluated even more.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, energy, utilities, and consumer staples lagged behind the index during the quarter. The strong recovery seen in the fourth quarter of 2022 bodes well for the future of emerging market equities in 2023. Let’s take a closer look at some of the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> key </code>factors that will drive growth in the coming year.</p>

<p>

    <span class="caption text-muted">Some Latin American countries can be the next hidden gem, considering that they have been reviled for some time </span>
</p>

<p>Despite facing difficulties in 2021 and 2022, such as slow vaccine distribution and the emergence of the Delta variant, there is potential for a rebound in emerging market (EM) economies. However, risks still persist. A potential catalyst for recovery could be a rise in interest rates, which is expected to bring developed-market GDP back to its trend line.</p>

<p>An<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> active </code>strategy in emerging market (EM) equities has the potential to outperform a US equity strategy in the next decade, as populations in EM countries grow and innovation continues to expand. The equity valuations in EM markets are relatively attractive, and earnings growth is currently at a decade-high. The region is home to many of the world’s top-performing companies, but these firms may not be included in standard benchmarks, which tend to heavily weight state-owned enterprises and industries that rely on exports. An<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> active </code>investment approach can provide investors with greater exposure to companies that are experiencing growth driven by secular trends.</p>

<h2 id="long-term-vision">Long-term vision</h2>

<p>Emerging markets are set to play a significant role in the global economy not just until 2025, but in the next decade. Despite facing challenges such as economic instability, political unrest, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, these markets have shown remarkable resilience and are poised for growth in the coming years.</p>

<p>One of the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> key </code>drivers of growth in emerging markets is their rapidly growing populations, which provide a large pool of consumers for both local and foreign businesses.</p>

<p>This, combined with increasing urbanization, rising incomes, and growing middle classes, creates a favourable environment for investment.</p>

<p>Another factor contributing to the growth of emerging markets is technological advancements, particularly in the areas of digital infrastructure, e-commerce, and fintech. This is providing new opportunities for businesses to reach customers and drive innovation in these markets.</p>

<p>In 2023 and 2024, some of the top emerging markets to watch include China, India, Brazil, Russia, and South Africa. These countries offer a diverse range of investment opportunities across various industries, including technology, healthcare, and infrastructure. The astonishing returns that occurred in the Turkish and Argentinian indices are not expected to continue in 2023.</p>

<p>China, with its large and growing middle class, is expected to continue to drive growth in Asia, while India is poised to become a major player in the global economy, thanks to its large and youthful population. In South America, the 2 big players, Brazil and Argentina, are set to benefit from a rebound in commodities prices and increased investment in infrastructure.</p>

<p>Russia, meanwhile, is poised to benefit from a recovering oil market, while South Africa is expected to see growth driven by its mineral resources, including gold and platinum.</p>

<p>You may have a look at some of these countries in this <a href="https://mrfreire.net/top-emerging-countries-2022/">article</a></p>

<h2 id="beware-of-the-risks">Beware of the risks</h2>

<p>However, while emerging markets offer significant opportunities, they also come with risks. Political and economic instability, currency fluctuations, and regulatory challenges are among the risks that investors must consider when investing in these markets.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, emerging markets are expected to continue to play an increasingly important role in the global economy over the next two years. With the right investment strategy, they offer the potential for high returns, while also helping to diversify portfolios and mitigate risk.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the next years are set to be exciting years for emerging markets, with opportunities for growth and investment in a range of industries. The prices we see are very attractive as entry level.</p>

<h2 id="research-and-where-to-start">Research and where to start</h2>

<p>As always, careful research and a well-considered investment strategy will be<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> key </code>to realizing the full potential of these dynamic and rapidly growing markets. However, instead of cherry-picking stocks, the best solution for most of us would be and index in order to collect returns from all countries.</p>

<div class="text-article">
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the` potential `to revolutionize the way we work and improve` productivity `across various industries. In the software development industry, AI is already being used to improve` productivity `in several ways.</div>

<p>One of the most common ways AI is being used to improve software<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>is through the use of code completion tools. These tools use AI algorithms to suggest code snippets or complete entire lines of code based on the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> context </code>of the current project. This can save developers a significant amount of time and effort by reducing the need for manual coding. Some examples of code completion tools include DeepTabNine, Kite, and TabNine.</p>

<p>Coding is a complex and time-consuming task that requires a lot of focus and attention to detail. However, there are many tools available that can help you improve your<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>and streamline your workflow. In this article, we will discuss some of the most popular tools that you can use to improve your coding productivity.</p>

<p>There are different ways to increase what we do in less time. IDEs, project management tools and methodologies or automations tools and some of these examples. Probably some of these improvements can also come from non-technology methods, but improving our lifestyle, focus and nutrition.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we will leave them for another time. Today we are going to discuss what AI can do in terms of efficiency. We are going to show two of the benefits of using them in our daily life. For this article, we will focus of one of the state-of-the-art tools, both of them powered by the OpenAI codex.</p>

<h2 id="github-copilot">GitHub Copilot</h2>

<p>Starting with Microsoft, GitHub Copilot is a powerful AI-powered code completion<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> tool </code>that allows developers to write code more efficiently and with fewer errors. This powerful<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> tool </code>can help developers to increase their<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>by reducing the time it takes to complete repetitive or complex tasks.</p>

<p>One of the main features of GitHub Copilot is its ability to provide code<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> suggestions </code>as developers type. This can help to save time by eliminating the need to manually search for the correct syntax or function. Additionally, Copilot also provides context-aware suggestions, which means that it can suggest different options based on the specific<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> context </code>of the code.</p>

<p>Another useful feature of GitHub Copilot is its ability to automatically fix common coding errors. This can save developers a significant amount of time, as they no longer need to spend time searching for and fixing errors. Additionally, Copilot can also help to improve code quality by suggesting improvements and best practices.</p>

<p>In addition to these features, GitHub Copilot also offers advanced functionality such as code refactoring, which can help developers to simplify and improve their code. This can be particularly useful when working on large and complex projects, as it can help to make the code more maintainable.</p>

<p>To use GitHub Copilot, developers need to have a GitHub account and the GitHub extension for IntelliJ,Pycharm, Visual Studio Code or your favorite IDE . Once the extension is installed, developers can start using Copilot by opening a new file or by hovering over a function or variable.</p>

<h2 id="chatgpt">ChatGPT</h2>

<p>ChatGPT is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI that can be used to increase coding productivity. It is a state-of-the-art machine learning model that can be used to generate code, complete code snippets, and even write entire programs.</p>

<p>One of the main benefits of using ChatGPT for coding is its ability to generate code quickly and accurately. With ChatGPT, developers no longer have to spend hours writing code from scratch or searching through documentation to find the right syntax. Instead, they can simply provide ChatGPT with a brief description of what they want to accomplish, and the model will generate the necessary code.</p>

<p>Another benefit of using ChatGPT for coding is its ability to learn from existing code. The model can analyze existing code and use that knowledge to generate new code that is consistent with the existing style and structure. This means that developers no longer have to spend time trying to conform to a specific coding style, as ChatGPT can automatically generate code that follows the style of the existing codebase.</p>

<p>Additionally, ChatGPT can also assist in code refactoring and bug fixing. It can analyze the code, find bugs and suggest fixes, or even generate the fix itself. This can save a lot of time and effort for developers who would otherwise have to manually scan through the code to find and fix bugs.</p>

<p>Another great feature of ChatGPT is its ability to write comments and documentation. This can be extremely helpful for developers who are working on complex projects and need to document their work. ChatGPT can analyze the code and generate comments and documentation that explain what the code is doing and how it works.</p>

<p>Furthermore, ChatGPT is a powerful<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> tool </code>that can be used to increase coding<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>in several ways. It can generate code quickly and accurately, learn from existing code, assist in code refactoring and bug fixing, write comments and documentation, and even generate entire programs. By incorporating ChatGPT into their workflow, developers can save time and effort while also improving the quality of their work.</p>

<p>On another hand, ChatGPT also has the ability to generate entire programs. It can take a high-level description of what the program should do and generate the entire codebase for it. This can be especially useful for developers who are working on proof-of-concepts or prototypes.</p>

<p>Of course, ChatGPT is no error-proof and due to the stored data, it could be the case that some code or libraries are old and/or deprecated. However, when writing one of the generated errors triggered in suggested blocks of code, ChatGPT will apologize for that and suggest new changes that will work. This is some of the situations several people have encountered. Once Microsoft complete the acquisition and ChatGPT has access to real time data, we will see what this<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> tool </code>is capable of.</p>

<p>We have seen that GitHub Copilot is a powerful<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> tool </code>that can help developers to increase their<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>by reducing the time it takes to complete repetitive or complex tasks. With its ability to provide code suggestions, automatically fix common coding errors and suggest improvements, Copilot can help developers to improve the quality of their code and increase their efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="a-lot-of-new-things-to-come">A lot of new things to come</h2>

<p>All of these features combined can greatly increase coding<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>and help developers focus on the more important aspects of their work such as designing and implementing new features, and solving complex problems.</p>

<p>To conclude with this short article AI is already being used to improve software<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> productivity </code>in several ways, and it is likely that its use will continue to expand in the future. By automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, AI can help developers to focus on more complex and creative tasks, ultimately leading to better software and more efficient development processes.</p>

<p>We are still on very early stages of the AI revolution. If all this is possible now, imagine what could be done when there is more data available, and we the different training models can be continuously improved in order to improve the loss function and enhance the different predictions. We have not yet seen the real power of AI, and it will still take some time until we are close to it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Javier Freire</name></author><category term="Work" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to software development, AI tools can really help the different developers to improve their work and to make it more efficient.

<div class="text-article">
Nomad work refers to a type of work that is not tied to a specific location or office, and can be done from anywhere in
the world with an internet connection. This type of work is becoming increasingly popular as more and more people are
able to take advantage of the flexibility and freedom that it offers. Besides, more and more companies are embracing
remote work and the use of technology makes it easier to stay connected and productive from any location.</div>

<p>Working from anywhere refers to the ability to do your job from any location, as long as you have access to the
necessary tools and resources. popular as the use of technology makes it easier to stay connected and productive from
any location.</p>

<p>If you don’t like monotony, who would not be willing to work while skiing in the Italian Alps, sunbathing in the Spanish
Canary Islands or diving in the exotic Bali?</p>

<h2 id="how-to-do-it">How to do it</h2>

<p>There are different types of nomad work, including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remote work</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">freelancing</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">digital nomadism</code>. Remote work
refers to any type of work that is done remotely, usually from home or a coworking space. Freelancing refers to working
as a self-employed individual, offering services to clients on a project-by-project basis. Digital nomadism is a
specific type of nomad work that involves traveling the world while working remotely.</p>

<p>One of the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> main </code>benefits of nomad work is the flexibility it offers. Instead of being tied to a specific location or
office, nomad workers have the freedom to choose where they want to work from. This allows them to work from home, a
coffee shop, a coworking space, or even from a different country.</p>

<p>Another benefit of working remotely is the ability to choose your own schedule. Many nomad workers have the freedom to
set their own schedule and work when it is convenient for them. This can be especially beneficial for those with
children or other responsibilities that make it difficult to work a traditional 9-5 job.</p>

<p>Nomad work also allows for a better work-life balance. Since nomad workers are not tied to a specific location, they
have the ability to travel and<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> experience </code>new cultures while still being able to work. This can be a great way to see
the world and have new experiences while still making a living.</p>

<p>However, nomad work is not for everyone. It can be challenging to stay motivated and focused when you are working from
home or a coworking space, and it can be difficult to build a professional network when you are constantly on the move.
It is also important to be self-disciplined and organized when working as a nomad, as there may not be the same level of
structure and oversight as there is in a traditional office setting.</p>

    <span class="caption text-muted">Having the benefit or chance of working from anywhere is a great opportunity to discover new countries and cultures. Maybe after that visit you would like to relocate this new place</span>
</p>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<p>These are some tips to help you when changing your mind and embracing this new lifestyle:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Determine your work needs: Consider what type of work you do and what resources you need in order to be productive.
This will help you determine the best location for your nomad work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find a reliable internet connection: A strong and stable internet connection is essential for nomad work, so make
sure you have access to one<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> wherever </code>you go.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set boundaries: It can be easy to get caught up in work when you are a nomad, so it is important to set boundaries
and make sure you take breaks and have a healthy work-life balance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stay organized: Nomad work can be disorganized at times, so it is important to have systems in place to keep track of
your work and stay on top of tasks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find a community: It can be lonely working as a nomad, so it is important to find a community of like-minded
individuals who can provide support and connection. This can be through online groups or by joining a coworking
space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plan for the future: Nomad work is not for everyone, and it is important to have a plan in place for the future in
case you decide to transition back to a more traditional work arrangement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protect your finances: Nomad work can be unpredictable, so it is important to have a financial safety net in place to
protect yourself in case of unexpected expenses or income fluctuations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stay in touch with home: Working abroad can be exciting, but it can also be homesickness. Make sure to stay in touch
with friends and family back home and keep them updated on your adventures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find temporary housing: If you will be working in a country for an extended period of time, it is a good idea to find
temporary housing rather than staying in a hotel. This can be more cost-effective and will also allow you to get a
better feel for local life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take care of your physical and mental health: It is important to prioritize your physical and mental health when you
   are a nomad, as it can be easy to neglect self-care when you are constantly on the move.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, nomad work offers many benefits, including flexibility, freedom, and the ability to choose your own schedule
and work from anywhere. However, it is not for everyone, and it is important to carefully consider whether it is the
right fit for you before making the decision to become a nomad worker.</p>

<p>Employees who are can enjoy working from anywhere may have more flexibility in their schedules, which can be especially
beneficial for those who have non-traditional work schedules or who may have difficulty taking time off due to family or
other commitments.</p>

<p>This aspect does not just benefit the employee, but the enterprise. Employees who have this type of flexibility are also
able to work more hours, be more creative and more productive. Furthermore, taking<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> holidays </code>should not be the only time
we have to visit other countries or regions.</p>

<p>Is the shift to remote work a temporary trend caused by the latest pandemic or a permanent change in the way we do
business? I think the last one, and I also have the opinion that still a lot of<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> corporations </code>have still to discover this

<div class="text-article">
What’s deep work and why you are hearing more and more this term? Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction
on a cognitively demanding task. It is a state of flow in which you are fully immersed in the task at hand and able to
produce high-quality work in a short amount of time. There are several` benefits `to practicing deep work.
</div>

<p>Deep work is a term coined by productivity expert and author Cal Newport to describe the state of intense focus and
concentration on a cognitively demanding task. In today’s world, where we are constantly bombarded with distractions and
notifications from our smartphones and computers, it can be difficult to achieve this state of deep work. However,
learning to<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> engage </code>in deep work can have significant<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> benefits </code>for our productivity and creativity.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>One of the key<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> benefits </code>of deep work is that it allows us to produce high-quality work in less time. When we are able to
focus intensely on a task without distractions, our brains are able to work more efficiently and we can make faster
progress. This is especially important in the age of information overload, where we often have a large amount of work to
do and limited time to do it.</p>

<p>In addition to being more efficient, deep work can also lead to higher-quality results. When we are able to focus deeply
on a task, we are able to think more critically and creatively, and this can result in better ideas and solutions. This
is especially important in fields that require a high level of creativity and problem-solving, such as research,
writing, and software development.</p>

<p>Although this may seem easy, different<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> factors </code>can affect our life.</p>

<p>achieving deep work is not always easy. In order to<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> engage </code>in deep work, we need to be able to eliminate distractions
and create an environment that is conducive to focus and concentration. This can involve setting aside dedicated blocks
of time for deep work, finding a quiet and comfortable place to work, and<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> using </code>tools and techniques to block out
distractions.</p>

<p>For example, some people find it helpful to use a Pomodoro timer to break their work into focused 25-minute intervals,
with short breaks in between. Others use noise-cancelling headphones or ambient noise apps to block out background noise
and help them concentrate. Some people even go to extreme lengths, such as disconnecting from the internet or working in
a secluded cabin in the woods, to create the optimal conditions for deep work.</p>

<p>There are several<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> benefits </code>of engaging in deep work:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Increased productivity: Deep work allows us to produce high-quality work in less time. When we are able to focus

<div class="text-article">
Trail running is a form of off-road running that takes place on hiking trails, dirt paths, and other natural terrain. It
is a popular outdoor activity that allows runners to explore the beauty of nature while also challenging themselves
physically and mentally.</div>

<p>One of the main benefits of trail running is the variety of scenery that it offers. Unlike road running, which often
takes place on dull, monotonous stretches of pavement, trail running allows runners to experience the beauty of forests,
mountains, and other natural environments. This can provide a much-needed change of scenery for runners who are used to
running on roads, and it can make the activity more enjoyable and stimulating.</p>

<p>In addition to the beautiful scenery, trail running also offers a number of physical and mental benefits. Running on
natural terrain can be more challenging than running on pavement, as it often involves steep hills, uneven surfaces, and
other obstacles. This can provide a more intense workout and help to improve a runner’s strength, endurance, and overall
fitness level.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>Trail running can also be a great way to reduce stress and improve mental health. Being outdoors in nature has been
shown to have a calming effect on the mind, and the physical exertion of running can help to release endorphins and
other feel-good chemicals in the brain. As a result, many people find that trail running helps them to relax, de-stress,
and feel more positive and energized.</p>

<p>To get started with trail running, it is<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> important </code>to have the right equipment. In addition to a good pair of running
shoes, it is also a good idea to invest in some other gear that is designed specifically for trail running. This can
include items such as a hydration<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> pack </code>or water bottle, trail running gaiters, and a hat or visor to protect your eyes
from the sun.</p>

<p>It is also<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> important </code>to choose a trail that is appropriate for your skill level. Beginners should start with easy,
well-maintained trails, and gradually work their way up to more challenging terrain as they become more experienced. It
is also a good idea to run with a buddy or in a group, as this can provide additional support and motivation.</p>

<p>There are many benefits to trail running, including:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Beautiful scenery: Unlike road running, which often takes place on dull, monotonous stretches of pavement, trail
running allows runners to experience the beauty of forests, mountains, and other natural environments. This can

  <li>Increased physical challenge: Running on natural terrain can be more challenging than running on pavement, as it
often involves steep hills, uneven surfaces, and other obstacles. This can provide a more intense workout and help to
improve a runner’s strength, endurance, and overall fitness level.</li>
  <li>Mental health benefits: Being outdoors in nature has been shown to have a calming effect on the mind, and the
physical exertion of running can help to release endorphins and other feel-good chemicals in the brain. As a result,
many people find that trail running helps them to reduce stress, improve their mood, and feel more positive and
energized.</li>
  <li>Improved coordination and balance: Trail running requires a higher level of coordination and balance than road
running, as runners must navigate uneven terrain and avoid obstacles. This can help to improve a runner’s overall
balance and coordination, and reduce the risk of falls and injuries.</li>
  <li>Social interaction: Many people find that trail running is a great way to meet new people and make friends who share
their<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> love </code>of the outdoors. Running with a buddy or in a group can provide additional support, motivation, and a
sense of community.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/trail/lost.jpeg" alt="Dangers of Trail Running" />
    <span class="caption text-muted">If you are new doing this activity, some aspects to consider are high temperatures, sunburn, wild animals or getting lost.</span>
</p>

<h2 id="things-to-consider">Things to consider</h2>

<p>There are several potential problems and dangers that can arise when trail running, including the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dehydration: Trail running can be strenuous, and it is<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> important </code>to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water before,
during, and after your run.</li>
  <li>Blisters: Ill-fitting shoes or wet socks can cause blisters to form on your feet, which can be painful and interfere
with your ability to run comfortably.</li>
  <li>Slips and falls: Trail running often involves running over uneven terrain, which can increase your risk of slipping
and falling. This can lead to injuries such as sprains, strains, and fractures.</li>
  <li>Sunburn: Many trail runs take place outdoors, where you may be exposed to the sun for extended periods of time. This
can lead to sunburn, which can be painful and increase your risk of skin cancer.</li>
  <li>Insect bites: Trail running can expose you to a variety of insects, such as mosquitoes and ticks, which can bite and
cause irritation.</li>
  <li>Wild animals: Depending on where you are trail running, you may encounter wild animals such as snakes, bears, and
mountain lions. It is<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> important </code>to be aware of your surroundings and take appropriate precautions to avoid any
potential encounters.</li>
  <li>Overuse injuries, such as shin splints or stress fractures, if you don’t properly warm up or cool down</li>
  <li>Exposure to the elements, such as cold temperatures or heavy rain, which can be dangerous if you’re not prepared</li>
  <li>Getting lost if you don’t have a map or don’t pay<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> attention </code>to your surroundings</li>
</ol>

<p>To avoid these dangers, it’s<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> important </code>to be prepared before heading out on the trail. Make sure you have the right
equipment and supplies, plan your route carefully, and pay<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> attention </code>to your surroundings. If you’re not sure about the
trail or if you’re unsure of your abilities, it’s always a good idea to start with shorter, easier trails and work your
way up to more challenging routes.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, Trail running is a great way to explore nature and get some exercise at the same time.</p>

<p>To get started with trail running, here are a few tips:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, make sure you have the right equipment. You will need a good pair of trail running shoes with good traction to
help you navigate the terrain. It’s also a good idea to bring a small backpack with water, snacks, and a map of the
trail.</li>
  <li>Before heading out on the trail, take some time to plan your route and check the weather. Choose a trail that is
appropriate for your skill level, and make sure you have a good idea of how long it will take you to complete the
route.</li>
  <li>When you’re out on the trail, pay<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> attention </code>to your surroundings and be aware of any potential hazards, such as steep
drop-offs or unstable ground. If you’re running with a group, make sure to stay together and help each other out if
anyone needs assistance.</li>
  <li>As you run, focus on maintaining a steady pace and keeping your breathing and heart rate under control. It’s okay to
take breaks if you need to catch your<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> breath </code>or rest your muscles, but<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> try </code>to keep moving forward to avoid getting
tired or losing motivation.</li>
  <li>Finally, listen to your body and pay<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> attention </code>to how you’re feeling. If you start to feel<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> pain </code>or discomfort, slow
down or stop and take a break. It’s<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> important </code>to take care of yourself while trail running to avoid injury and ensure
you have a safe and enjoyable experience.</li>
</ol>

<div class="text-article">
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning are two closely related fields that have garnered a lot of attention in
recent years. AI is a broad term that refers to the ability of a machine or computer program to simulate human
intelligence and perform tasks that typically require human cognition, such as learning, problem-solving, and
decision-making.</div>

<p>Deep learning, on the other hand, is a subset of AI that uses large neural networks with multiple layers of processing
to learn and make decisions based on data.</p>

<p>The<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> history </code>of AI can be traced back to the 1950s, when<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> researchers </code>began exploring the possibility of creating machines
that could perform tasks that required human intelligence.</p>

<p>Early AI research focused on creating algorithms that could mimic human decision-making processes and problem-solving
abilities. However, the limitations of computing power at the time meant that these early AI systems were not able to
handle the large amounts of data and complex calculations required for more advanced tasks.</p>

<p>The rise of the internet and the availability of large datasets in the 1990s provided a major boost to AI research. This
led to the development of new algorithms and techniques, such as decision trees and support vector machines, that could
handle large amounts of data and make more accurate predictions. However, these algorithms still relied on human input
to define the rules and criteria used to make decisions, which limited their ability to learn and adapt to new
situations.</p>

<p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses large neural networks with multiple layers of processing to learn and make
decisions based on data. These networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain, with each layer of neurons
performing a specific function and passing information to the next layer for further processing. Unlike traditional AI
algorithms, deep learning algorithms do not require human input to define the rules and criteria used to make decisions.
Instead, they are able to learn from the data they are given and improve their performance over time.</p>

<h2 id="deep-learning">Deep Learning</h2>

<p>One of the key advantages of deep learning is its ability to handle unstructured data, such as images, audio, and text.
This has made it particularly useful in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech
recognition, where traditional AI algorithms struggle to make sense of complex and unstructured data. For example, deep
learning algorithms have been used to develop image recognition systems that can accurately identify objects in images,
and language<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> translation </code>systems that can accurately translate text from one language to another.</p>

<p>Deep learning has also been used in a variety of other fields, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. In
healthcare, deep learning algorithms have been used to identify patterns in medical images that may indicate the
presence of certain diseases, such as cancer. In finance, deep learning algorithms have been used to analyze large
amounts of market data and make predictions about stock prices and other<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> asset </code>classes.</p>

<p>Despite these advantages, there are also challenges and limitations to the use of deep learning. One of the main
challenges is the need for large amounts of data to train the algorithms, which can be difficult to obtain in some
applications. In addition, deep learning algorithms can be complex and difficult to interpret, making it difficult to
understand why they make certain predictions or decisions. This can be a problem in applications where explainability is
important, such as in medical diagnosis or financial decision-making.</p>

<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>

<p>The future of deep learning looks bright, with<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> researchers </code>and companies continuing to invest in this field to develop
new applications and technologies. In the next few years, we can expect to see deep learning algorithms become even more
powerful and versatile, with the ability to handle even larger and more complex datasets.</p>

<p>One of the key areas where deep learning is expected to have a significant impact is in healthcare. Deep learning
algorithms are already being used to analyze medical images and identify patterns that may indicate the presence of
certain diseases. In the future, we can expect to see these algorithms become even more accurate and able to handle a
wider range of medical data, such as genomics and electronic health records. This could potentially lead to more
personalized and effective treatments for patients, and help healthcare providers to diagnose and treat diseases more
efficiently.</p>

<p>Another area where deep learning is expected to have a major impact is in transportation. Deep learning algorithms are
already being used in self-driving cars to enable them to navigate roads and avoid obstacles. In the future, we can
expect to see these algorithms become even more advanced, with the ability to handle a wider range of driving conditions
and scenarios. This could potentially lead to the development of safer and more efficient self-driving cars, and pave
the way for the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p>In addition, deep learning is also expected to play a significant role in the development of smart cities. Deep learning
algorithms can be used to analyze large amounts of data from sensors and other sources to identify patterns and trends,
and help city planners and policymakers to make more informed decisions. For example, deep learning algorithms could be
used to analyze traffic data to optimize the flow of vehicles on roads, or to monitor energy usage in buildings to
improve efficiency.</p>

</p>

<h2 id="deep-learning-and-the-workforce">Deep Learning and the workforce</h2>

<p>The rise of deep learning has had a significant impact on the workforce, with many companies and industries starting to
adopt this technology to improve efficiency and productivity. Deep learning algorithms are able to learn from large
amounts of data and make predictions and decisions based on that data, which makes them well-suited for a wide range of
tasks and applications.</p>

<p>One of the key ways that deep learning is being used in the workforce is in automating tasks that were previously
performed by humans. Many companies are using deep learning algorithms to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks,
such as data entry and analysis, customer service, and scheduling. This allows employees to focus on more complex and
value-added tasks, and can improve overall productivity and efficiency.</p>

<p>However, the widespread adoption of deep learning in the workforce has also raised concerns about job displacement. As
deep learning algorithms become more advanced and are able to perform more tasks, there is a risk that they could
replace human workers in many industries. This could potentially lead to job losses and increased unemployment, and
could have a negative impact on the economy.</p>

<p>To address this concern, it is important for companies and policymakers to invest in training and education programs
that can help workers acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to work<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> alongside </code>deep learning algorithms and adapt to
new technologies. This could include training programs in areas such as data analysis, programming, and machine
learning, which can help workers to develop the skills needed to work with deep learning algorithms and other emerging
technologies.</p>

<p>In conclusion, deep learning is having a significant impact on the workforce, with many companies using this technology
to automate tasks and improve efficiency. While this has the potential to bring many benefits, it also raises concerns
about job displacement and the need for workers to adapt to new technologies. To address these challenges, it is
important for companies and policymakers to invest in training and education programs that can help.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, the future of deep learning looks very promising, with the potential to transform a wide range of industries
and applications. As deep learning algorithms continue to evolve and become more powerful, we can expect to see even
more exciting other useful applications in this field.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<div class="text-article">
2021 was the year of the NFTs where we saw a boom in the Non-Fungible Token trading transaction volume thanks to the
ERC-721 standard created back in 2018. This trend seems that has diminished recently in the current crypto bear market,
but contrary to what some people thought we have more and more marketplaces and sites that offer you the chance to
discover your next collectible.</div>

<p>Although NFTs are known for art and just some characteristic images, this article will not be focused merely on the
artistic side, but also other utilities that Non-Fungible Tokens can bring to your entertainment and lifestyle.</p>

<p>The term Non-Fungible Token means that this item is unique and cannot be duplicated. If you are the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> owner </code>of an NFT,
this piece belongs just to you and this ownership is reflected in the blockchain network. Different Blockchain network
such as the mentioned one from Ethereum or others such as Avalanche, or Solana make this possible.</p>

<h2 id="origins-of-nfts">Origins of NFTs</h2>

<p>It all happened in 2021. There is no exact reason for the boom of NFTs during this year, but there some<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> events </code>that most
probably had something to do with the rise of NFTs.</p>

<p>During this period, more and more people jumped into the crypto world. In some cases, they did not have a previous
investment background and this phenomenon opened many doors in the retail industry. Furthermore, some famous people and
investment firms also promoted this change. Besides, Investment banks that had criticized Bitcoin in the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> past </code>changed
their mind and some of these firms started also offering these alternative assets to their clients.</p>

<p>On one hand, the central banks low-interest or quantitative easing policies caused a huge increase on the price of the different
crypto assets. Another topic that helped with this was the creation of different communities such as Bored Apples or
CryptoPunks</p>

<p>If we put everything into the mix, we saw what we saw with the explosion of NFTs that occurred some years ago and the
adoption of these in the society.</p>

<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>

<p>However, although NFTs may be linked to pictures or avatars, there are a lot of areas beyond this topic where NFTs can
play a great role, either now or in the years to come. Although it may seem interesting too, we will not talk about the
several millions that were paid to acquire some NFTs in auction houses such as Christie’s or on-chain.</p>

<p>If you have not realized about the potential across sectors that NFTs have, you will probably see that these will impact
for good these sectors in the future.</p>

<h3 id="art">Art</h3>

<p>With the democratization of art, this means that all artists can promote their creativity and by doing so, they are also
able to reach to more people. With NFTs, you and only you are the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> owner </code>of these unique pieces. Who know where the next
Picasso or Dali will be? This means that art lovers and the search of the next gem is not limited to just some
privileged collectors with good connections, but to everyone who loves art and beauty.</p>

<h3 id="videogames">Videogames</h3>

<p>Non-Fungible Tokens have a lot of possibilities when it comes to the gaming industry. The boom of online video games,
e-sports and open world games have helped achieve this. If we think about the most iconic series, several utilities can
be proposed.</p>

<p>For example, in MOBA games such as League of Legends, having a unique skin and spell effects for you character could not
just improve your gaming experience but also trade with them after you get tired of it.</p>

<p>Although the normal price of skins is considerably low, this means that they are not unique, and you may see all the
time the same ones when playing the game. Knowing the number of fanatic gamers, it would be interesting for some of them
to have a unique skin that would make other players jealous. For companies, it would need to be checked whether this
business model makes sense (high volume and low price or selling just one single skin for several thousands of dollars)</p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>

<p>Instead of collecting limited edition vinyl records or CDs, the next step in our constantly changing world could be
having the original copy or even special edition versions or unreleased remixes of top hits. Instead of having the
physical copy you would have it registered in the blockchain.</p>

<p>For musicians and DJs, this can be a great very interesting mechanism, same as art makers, to promote their job and
access to different users<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> around </code>the world. This also removes intermediaries that take a big piece of the cake.</p>

<p>For example, if you like EDM and you go to festivals often, you may have noticed that recently the songs that the
different DJs play are the ones that are being played everywhere, and they tend to play the latest hits. You may have
seen this in festivals such as Ultra or Tomorrowland. This makes the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> music </code>sessions not as original as before.</p>

<p>If you attend one of these sets, this can be the only time you can hear a specific unreleased song because they are the
sole owners of this one. Some collectors may be interested on this specific version and request the artist to buy it.</p>

<p>In connection to the commercial side of this feature, since you are the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> owner </code>of this song, you could set a
subscription/reproduction fee if someone wants to play your song.</p>

<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/nfts/dog-vinyls.jpg" alt="The new collection method" />
    <span class="caption text-muted">Nostalgic collectors may not think the same, but collecting` music `in new format files add many new possibilities and reduces problems such as storage or conservation of old formats
</span>
</p>

<h3 id="videos">Videos</h3>

<p>The movies sector didn’t change much in the last decade until Covid arrived. Starting 2020, since people could not go
out, there were several days for some long-awaited movies. In other cases, that they allowed was to offer the movies via
some streaming platforms.</p>

<p>However, what could really revolutionize the art of collecting records of the different movies would be the chance of
having original and unique recordings, such as shorts or cut scenes of your favorite movie. If you think about fans of
the most well-known sagas such as Star Wars or the Godfather, these items could have an exponential increase in a few
years from now.</p>

<h3 id="tickets">Tickets</h3>

<p>Imagine going to a football game or concert. This is nothing unusual and something that everyone has done. If you for
example go to a world cup final, you may record videos, etc., but one of the things probably you will want to keep it
for this unique experience will be the tickets of the match you attended.</p>

<p>The same could be applied to other events. Imagine going to last tour of your favorite<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> music </code>band before they split or
retire. This is also something quite unique that would like to keep, and it’s probably that something will increase their
value with the years should you want to sell it later.</p>

<h3 id="creating-and-minting-nfts">Creating and minting NFTs</h3>

<p>The good thing about the NFTs is that the steps to create them are quite easy. It’s not correct that in order to take
part in these topics you are required to have a technical profile. You may have heard the term “Mint”. This is basically
registering the NFT on the blockchain, which in this case will show that belong to your wallet. Obviously, you will need
to create something unique, for which you will need to show some creativity and originality. However, once you completed
your first work, the steps can be summarized as follows:</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-wallet">Creating a Wallet</h3>

<p>If you are new to the crypto world, don’t be afraid of terms. Creating a wallet is something that not many people do at
the moment, but I can guarantee that as with other technologies, in the future everyone will have their own wallet where
they can keep and guard their assets without the need of a middleman. As just discussed, this is something that anyone can do
regardless of their background and technology skills.</p>

<p>Some of the most popular wallets out there are Metamask, Coinbase Wallet or Phantom.</p>

<h3 id="choosing-the-chain">Choosing the chain</h3>

<p>The choice of the wallet is linked to the blockchain where you operate and the marketplace where you want to show your
item. Some blockchains you may consider are Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Tezos. The chain you use will have an impact
in the site or platform where you want to show your NFTs. As with the wallet, the marketplace you choose in the second
point is also linked to this step.</p>

<h3 id="selecting-the-nft-marketplace">Selecting the NFT marketplace</h3>

<p>Some of the most famous sites to trade NFTs are OpenSea, Magic Eden or Rarible and they offer different However, as we
discussed in the introduction, you see more and more often new places dedicated to certain niche markets.</p>

<p>If you are new into this world, some benefits of OpenSea is that you don’t pay any gas fees when minting and
these fees are just paid if you sell your NFT.</p>

<h3 id="tokenizing-the-nft">Tokenizing the NFT</h3>

<p>When creating the NFT, it is recommended to<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> provide </code>additional information and not just the basic details. For example,
include some details like the name, the collection, and other technical details.</p>

<h3 id="showing-and-selling-the-nft">Showing and selling the NFT</h3>

<p>Once you have linked your wallet to the desired site, you can just show your collection, sell the items, or buy new NFTs
to add to your collection. In this example, I just included the basic steps, but of course the industry is constantly
evolving, and you will see new wallets, marketplaces and chains.</p>

<p>If you want to have a look at my collection, you can just go to the<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> links </code>below:</p>

<div class="text-article">
Eating is one of the pleasures of life and apart from that a way of being` able `to meet with family and friends. However, `although` we are not `conscious` of it, eating well or bad plays an important role in our life (mood, work, sport, etc.). Although it was `probably` today when we have more access to information, it is also the era where producers try to include in the market products with ingredients that can be `harmful` for us. It’s quite also understandable that more and more people have obesity problems. Although` governments `are trying to put a remedy to this trend or even “modern disease”, instead of rules, what we should do is educate people and let them know about all consequences.
</div>

<p>I, as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">probably</code> you, love eating and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">probably</code> you are also trying to taste new flavors or discover new restaurants.
However, I’m also telling you<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> nothing </code>new when I<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> say </code>that this exercise in excess can have very bad consequences, that
will slowly hurt your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code>.</p>

<p>It’s strange, but true, we are what we eat. Whoever said this sentence for the first time, he knew what he was doing.</p>

<p>It’s strange, but true, we are what we eat. Whoever said this sentence for the first time, he knew what he was doing.</p>

<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>

<p>Although it may <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">see</code>m that eating just negative consequences in few aspects (our physical <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code> and the shape), it
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">probably</code> has even worse consequences in other aspects of our life, which are of course more important than keeping a
flat belly. You will <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">see</code> for example people who eat poor quality food, they remain thin, but you will <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">see</code> other aspects
that are indicative of their diet. These symptoms are more severe than the look of their silhouette.</p>

<h3 id="fatigue">Fatigue</h3>

<p>When you eat heavy food, with a<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> lot </code>of calories, our organs need to switch to “hard-work” mode, and they consume more
energy in order to be<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> able </code>to digest them. Simply mathematics, our organs need to allocate more energy to this task, and
there will be less energy in order to do the remaining tasks, leading to feeling tired and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">without</code> desired to do
anything.</p>

<p>Some examples of unhealthy nutrients having a considerable impact in this point are those containing too much sugar,
salt, or flour. They can be an instant boost of energy, but this effect is lost some minutes later, leading to the
opposite results.</p>

<h3 id="mood">Mood</h3>

<p>We have more and more advances and breakthroughs in different aspects, making our life easier. The problem is that
despite these improvements, why with better conditions there are more and more burnouts, depressions, and even people
committing suicide? Of course, there are other reasons, but one of the factors is related to the food. One of the
reasons, is that eating products<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> high </code>in trans-fat, they have a direct impact into our stress hormones. This causes us
to be more aggressive, irritable, and making our mood and motivation drop to the bottom.</p>

<h3 id="focus">Focus</h3>

<p>Related to our intellectual activity, try to study, or work, and you will also <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">see</code> that having a bad diet will cause
problems with your<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> lucidity </code>and agility. You can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">see</code> this for example when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">focus</code>ing on a complex task or memorizing
topics, or even a single number.</p>

<h3 id="long-term-diseases">Long-term diseases</h3>
<p>It is not surprise that countries with healthy diets have a higher expected life. Furthermore, there are several studies
that link the effects of eating unhealthy food to different diseases. This of course is not applicable to food, but
other products we<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> drink </code>or inhale. The solution is easy: If you want to live longer, start taking care of what your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code>
is using as fuel.</p>

<h3 id="recovery">Recovery</h3>

<p>Nutrition has an important role in both, mental and physical. Try to practice sport with a good diet and a bad diet and
you will note the difference and how much it some activities cost or how you are tired after the workout.</p>

<p>As we have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">see</code>n for concentration, we need to take care of what we provide to our brain, so it is possible to</p>

<h2 id="how-to-fix-this">How to fix this</h2>

<p>Having <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">see</code>n what is<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> causing </code>problems to our health, there should be something we can do about it. These are some tricks
in order to help us with a perfect nutrition <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aimed</code> to achieve the best performance.</p>

<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/nutrition/fruit.jpg" alt="Fruits and Vegetables" />
    <span class="caption text-muted">Eating seasons `vegetables` and fruits is an excellent way to discover new and tasty combinations
</span>
</p>

<h3 id="plan">Plan</h3>

<p>When it comes to food, as in many other aspects in life, you cannot improvise. Have an empty fridge and go to the last
minute to the supermarket, and I can assure you that you will <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">probably</code> end up with post processed food and low-quality
nutrients. This is definitely not the way. Another benefit is that with this technique you can avoid unnecessary
products in the supermarket and save a considerable amount of money.</p>

<h3 id="be-constant">Be constant</h3>

<p>This one may be also quite evident, but it is usual that a<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> lot </code>of people start with their diet very motivated. In this
case being constant is of course much more important than the intensity. Define realistic and feasible goals. Otherwise,
in 1 week you will get back where you started.</p>

<h3 id="variety">Variety</h3>
<p>Changing what you eat, while innovating makes sure that you are not bored of the monotony. With this in mind, you can
create multiple combinations and have fun avoiding already prepared post processed foods.</p>

<p>You may be thinking that having to think about what you need to each every day may sound a bit annoying at first sight.
However, this will give you a better organization of what to prepare. Furthermore, one of the tricks is also to take
benefit of the seasonal products and enjoy the flavor of these products.</p>

<h3 id="time-to-break-the-rules-sometimes">Time to break the rules (sometimes)</h3>

<p>Although this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">see</code>ms the opposite of what’s included above, you could have your cheat day, e.g., on the weekend. However,
even if in the beginning you will be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">probably</code> yearning for this day to arrive, you may realize about the following. The
day after you go for this special day, you will feel heavier and not as healthy as the previous days. Our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code> is
intelligent enough to warn us about something they did not like and it’s<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> causing </code>our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code> to suffer.</p>

<div class="text-article">
The fifth period of the Algorand Governance is about to start and there are some changes being introduced in this phase. The registration will close on October 20th and the rewards will be paid once the period ends on December 31st. 
As in `previous` governances, the `payout` of the rewards should be on the first week of January and depending on the wallet you use, you may also receive an NFT.

Nonetheless, before continuing, it may be relevant to know more about how it works.
</p>
</div>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>

<p>As described some months ago, in the Governance Period you can vote and participate in cool initiatives that are
proposed by the Algorand Foundation. By voting on the different proposals, you get rewarded. It’s important to note that
during the 3-month period, the amount of ALGO tokens you commit must be untouched. Reducing the balance means losing the
access to the reward. In addition to holding, it is key that you vote for your preferred option. For example, one user
committing 20,000 ALGO and selling 100 ALGO on the last day will not get anything. Instead another user committing 1,000
ALGO and keeping that amount or more will get the reward. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the committed
amount and just include there what you are sure you can maintain. Nothing happens if you allocate more than the
committed ALGO once the governance period has started on 15 October. The rewards you earn are calculated by dividend the
total number of tokens (70.5 million) by the number of committed ALGOs from all governors. You can also see the
statistics in the following page: https://www.algorandstats.com/governance-period-5</p>

<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>

<p>One of the points that some users have brought is that guaranteeing a risk-free return of 10% (around 2.5% <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">every</code>
quarter) cannibalizes other DeFi projects around Algorand. This was one of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">topics</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">previous</code> voting sessions, where
there were some initiatives to push different DeFi and FutureFi projects, giving some benefits to these projects.</p>

<p>In order to respond to this, one of the measures was to incentivize DeFi users in order to push different projects and
allocate 7M ALGO tokens to DeFi governors. This was the option the Governance Foundation supported in the last
Governance period.</p>

    <span class="caption text-muted">The different 4 steps can be defined above for the fifth period
</span>
</p>

<h2 id="key-projects">Key projects</h2>
<p>As you may recall from this article, the main 3 pillars of the Algorand usage are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Payments</li>
  <li>NFTs</li>
  <li>Stablecoins</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the projects built on the Algorand network are related to DeFi and some of them
have been also developed thanks to grants coming the Algorand foundation. Knowing the most important <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">topics</code>, it’s also
the moment to talk about the most popular projects. Some of the most well-known projects using the Algorand network are
the following</p>

<h3 id="1-tinyman">1. Tinyman</h3>

<p>Tinyman is a decentralized exchange where swappers trade different assets and poolers provide liquidity to the liquidity
pools. What’s the objective of doing so? In this DEX, Poolers get a part of the fees that swappers pay when exchanging
the different tokens.</p>

<p><a href="https://tinyman.org/">Tinyman</a></p>

<h3 id="2-folks-finance">2. Folks Finance</h3>
<p>Folks Finance is built on top of the Algorand chain and it’s used to grant users the possibility
lend and borrow assets in this platform. One of the benefits of this platform is that users can still participate in the
Algorand governance session without renouncing to the liquidity. This is achieved with an ALGO token twin called gALGO
with a 1 to 1 equivalent.</p>

<p><a href="https://folks.finance/">Folks Finance</a></p>

<h3 id="3-algofi">3. AlgoFI</h3>
<p>AlgoFi is also a decentralized exchange and a lending protocol. By lending different assets, the owners can
get rewarded with some interest. The borrowers of these assets deposit some assets as collateral. One of the advantages
of this is that even if used as collateral, the ALGO tokens can be committed to the Algorand Governance.</p>

<p><a href="AlgoFI">AlgoFI</a></p>

<h3 id="4-algoswap">4. AlgoSwap</h3>
<p>AlgoSwap is another decentralized exchange which can be integrated into different dApps with just a few
lines of code. This makes it a great integration tool enabling users to build their DEX platforms with minimum effort.</p>

<h2 id="wallets">Wallets</h2>
<p>Continuing with the next steps and the Governance process, it is time to focus on how to store our ALGO
tokens. As you have seen, there are many projects around Algorand and many ways to commit your ALGO Tokens. Some of the
most popular wallets out there are:</p>

<h3 id="a-myalgo">a) MyAlgo</h3>
<p>MyAlgo is one of the most intuitive wallets out there, with some advance features such as signing multiple
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transaction</code>s at the same time or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transaction</code>-grouping.</p>

<p><a href="https://wallet.myalgo.com/">MyAlgo</a></p>

<h3 id="b-perawallet">b) PeraWallet</h3>
<p>PeraWallet is a decentralized wallet, easily used in both mobile and laptops, with ledger support too.
It’s easy to access the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transaction</code> history, holdings or NFTs.</p>

<p><a href="https://perawallet.app/">PeraWallet</a></p>

<h3 id="c-algosigner">c) AlgoSigner</h3>
<p>AlgoSigner an extension for Chrome that can be used as an Algorand wallet. It lets users approve and
sign <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transaction</code>s that are generated by Algorand applications. The benefit of AlgoSigner is that there is you can grant
access to different dApps without giving them access you your keys and that it can be integrated into easily into DEX.</p>

<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/algosigner/kmmolakhbgdlpkjkcjkebenjheonagdm">AlgoSigner</a></p>

<p>Related to getting ALGO, it is in most popular centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase or Kraken. Therefore, it
should not be a problem to get it you’re your preferred platform. As with crypto, it is recommended that as soon as you
get it, if you are not trading it, you move it to one of the mentioned wallets in order to participate in the Goverance
period or in your cold wallet.</p>

<h2 id="measures--other">Measures &amp; Other</h2>
<p>Related to the voting, the measures that will be proposed in the upcoming period are still not now
and nothing is expected until November. Nonetheless, considering the latest proposals and ongoing projects around
Algorand, it would not surprise that the voting sessions go in the direction of boosting the power of DeFi and FutureFi.</p>

<p>In this governance period, it seems that there are some people sending some small amounts to the different governors.
They include some messages and are not coming from the official Algorand Foundation. The most important thing is not to
click on them because they are spam messages.</p>

<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
<p>Taking part in the Governance period, you are contributing to the future of finance. Algorand, one of the most sustainable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chains</code>, is proof of stake, and we have
seen the positive impact in the environment that this mechanism has with the Ethereum Merge. It’s also one of the
reasons for being named the Green Blockchain- Other benefits of the Algorand network are the low fees, speed and its
zero <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">downtime</code>, which cannot be said from other networks such as Solana. Therefore, if you want to be part of this
adventure, don’t forget to commit your ALGO before the deadline on 21 October.</p>

<p>Once the voting session is published, you
should not forget to vote, since just users who voted for any of the options will be eligible to receive a stake of the
70.5 million ALGO tokens to be paid on beginning of January</p>]]></content><author><name>Javier Freire</name></author><category term="Crypto" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Algorand Governance Period is about to start.
