    <small class="post-subtitle">The Merge Continuation A few months ago, we discussed the most important changes that the Ethereum Merge would bring and in fact delivered to the users. With this change, as you know, the most significant change was that the “old” Proof of Work was replaced by the Proof of Stake Protocol. These are basically the most important changes that are possible now thanks to the Merge. Improved energy efficiency: PoS uses less energy compared to PoW, which is expected to significantly reduce Ethereum’s carbon footprint. Increased scalability: The merge made the Ethereum network more scalable, as PoS can process more...</small>

    <small class="post-subtitle">Outlook 2023 Despite facing numerous obstacles in 2022, emerging market equities began to show signs of recovery in the last quarter of 2022. This trend is expected to continue during 2023 due to factors such as robust growth, declining inflation, a softening US dollar, and favorable fundamentals. In light of the widespread decline in equity markets during 2022, emerging market equities are believed to be one of the most undervalued asset classes, offering attractive valuations compared to historical norms.
