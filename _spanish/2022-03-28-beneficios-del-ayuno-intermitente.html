<h2>
    Introducción
</h2>
<div class="text-article">
    Intermittent fasting brings several benefits in different aspects such as
    health, recovery, or weight loss. While this trend has been very famous recently in the western culture,
    there are some benefits of the 16/8 rule (26 hours fasting and 8 hours for having meals).
    Due to the different advantages, some different cultures of the world have been applying this for centuries.
</div>
<p>
    In this post we discuss some of the benefits that intermittent fasting can
    bring to our life. We had also tried to validate most of the benefits with
    some scientific studies.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from the different tests, I have been using this for many years now
    and I can tell you that my health and my state of form has improved during
    this time. Here are some benefits for the long-term that fasting could
    bring to your life.
</p>
<h2>
    El peso y la grasa
</h2>
<p>
    Many people who try <a name="OLE_LINK1"></a>    <a name="OLE_LINK2">intermittent </a>fasting do so to lose weight. In
    general, intermittent fasting will cause you to eat fewer meals and
    therefore, a reduction of calories.
</p>
<p>
    Unless you offset this by eating a lot more during other meals, you will
    end up consuming fewer calories. Further, intermittent fasting improves
    hormone function to facilitate weight loss.
</p>
<p>
    Lower levels of insulin, higher levels of MBH, and higher amounts of
    norepinephrine (noradrenaline) increase the breakdown of body fat and
    facilitate its use to generate energy. For this reason, short-term fasting
    increases the metabolic rate, helping burn even more calories than in
    normal situations.
</p>
<p>
    In other words, intermittent fasting has two functions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It increases your metabolic rate
    </li>
    <li>
        It reduces the amount of food you eat
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    According to a 2014 review of the scientific research, intermittent fasting
    can cause a weight loss of 3 percent to 8 percent in 3 to 24 weeks. This
    amount is huge.
</p>
<p>
    A 2011 review also showed that intermittent fasting caused less muscle loss
    than continuous calorie restriction.
</p>
<h2>
    Sugar and Diabetes
</h2>
<p>
    Diabetes 2 is one of the diseases growing faster in the last decade. Its
    main characteristic is high blood sugar levels in the context of insulin
    resistance.
</p>
<p>
    Anything that reduces insulin resistance should help lower blood sugar
    levels and protect against type 2 diabetes. Intermitting fasting can help
    with this.
</p>
<p>
    For example, intermittent fasting has been shown to have major benefits for
    insulin resistance and cause an impressive reduction in blood sugar levels.
</p>
<p>
    In human studies on intermittent fasting, fasting blood sugar was reduced
    by 3 percent to 6 percent over the course of 8 to 12 weeks in people with
    prediabetes. Fasting insulin was reduced by 20 percent to 31 percent.
</p>
<p>
    What does this mean? intermittent fasting may be highly protective for
    people who are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

    <span class="caption text-muted">Although it may take some time to get adapted, fasting brings multiple benefits</span>
</p>
<h2>
    Heart
</h2>
<p>
    Coronary problems and heart disease is currently the disease killing most
    people in the world. Related to this problem, several risk factors are
    known to be associated with an increased or decreased risk of heart
    disease.
</p>
<p>
    Intermittent fasting has been shown to improve several different risk
    factors, including:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
        blood sugar levels
    </li>
    <li>
        blood pressure
    </li>
    <li>
        blood triglycerides
    </li>
    <li>
        (bad) cholesterol
    </li>
    <li>
        inflammatory markers
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>
    Cellular Recovery
</h2>
<p>
    When we fast, the body's cells initiate a cellular "waste disposal" process
    called autophagy.
</p>
<p>
    This process involves cells breaking down and metabolizing broken and
    dysfunctional proteins that accumulate within cells over time.
</p>
<p>
    Increased autophagy may protect against several diseases, including cancer
    and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
</p>
<h2>
    Brain
</h2>
<p>
    We have discussed different benefits and advantages for our body. What is
    good for the body is often also good for the most important organ, our
    brain.
</p>
<p>
    Intermittent fasting improves several metabolic functions that are known to
    be important for brain health.
</p>
<p>
    Intermittent fasting helps to reduce:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        blood sugar levels
    </li>
    <li>
        oxidative stress
    </li>
    <li>
        inflammation
    </li>
    <li>
        insulin resistance
    </li>
    <li>
        Fasting also increases levels of a brain hormone called brain-derived
        neurotrophic factor (BDNF). A deficiency of BDNF has been implicated in
        depression and various other brain problems.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Other studies have also shown that intermittent fasting protects against
    brain damage due to stroke.
</p>
<h2>
    Hormones
</h2>
<p>
    When you don't eat for a period of time, several things happen in your body
    related to the hormones and internal organs.
</p>
<p>
    For example, your body changes hormone levels to make stored body fat more
    accessible and initiate important cellular repair and recovery processes.
</p>
<p>
    These are some of the hormones changes that occur thanks to fasting:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Insulin levels. Insulin levels in the blood drop significantly, making
        it easier to burn fat.
    </li>
    <li>
        Human growth hormone (HGH) levels. Blood levels of human growth hormone
        (HGH) can increase dramatically. Higher levels of this hormone make it
        easier to burn fat and build muscle and have many other benefits.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cellular repair. The body induces important cellular repair processes,
        such as removing waste from cells.
    </li>
    <li>
        Gene expression. There are beneficial changes in several genes and
        molecules related to longevity and disease protection.
    </li>
    <li>
        Many of the benefits of intermittent fasting are related to these
        changes in hormones and cells
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Stress
</h2>
<p>
    Oxidative stress is one of the steps towards aging and many chronic
    diseases. We all want to avoid this. It involves unstable molecules called
    free radicals. Free radicals react with and damage other important
    molecules, such as protein and DNA.
</p>
<p>
    Several studies show that intermittent fasting can improve the body's
    resistance to oxidative stress. In addition, studies show that intermittent
    fasting can help fight inflammation, another key component in many common
    diseases.
</p>
<h2>
    Cancer
</h2>
<p>
    Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and it’s also one of
    the most problematic diseases.
</p>
<p>
    Fasting has been shown to have several beneficial effects on metabolism
    that may reduce the risk of cancer.
</p>
<p>
    Promising evidence from animal studies indicates that intermittent fasting
    or diets that mimic fasting may help prevent cancer. Research in humans has
    had similar findings, although more studies are needed. There is also some
    evidence that fasting reduced several side effects of chemotherapy in
    humans.
</p>
<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    Although we have been taught that breakfast is the most important of the
    day, this is due to the interest of the food industry in the past decades.
    We should forget about this myth and follow what it’s good for our body.
</p>
<p>
    Related to some questions you may have questions about what you can do and
    cannot do.
    It’s perfectly fine to drink water, coffee, or tea as long as you don’t put
    sugar. Furthermore, it is also fine to put a small amount of milk.
</p>
<p>
    Probably the hardest time is starting with the intermittent fasting and it
    may not be made for every person. I can just tell my experience about it
    and the different noticeable that has brought to me. I hope this can be of
    any use to you in your life. In this post we have seen different benefits
    and you may also take this into account if you would like to start with it.
